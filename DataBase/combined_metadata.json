Therefore, the context in which an issue is presented within a film or video may be given consideration. Factors such as the setting of a work (historical, fantasy, realistic, contemporary etc.), the manner of presentation of the content, the apparent intention of the content, the original production date of the content, and any special merits of the work may influence the classification decision. (b) Theme: Classification decisions may take into the theme of any content but will depend significantly on the treatment of that theme, especially the sensitivity of its presentation. The most challenging themes (for example, drug misuse, violence, pedophilia, sex, racial or communal hatred or violence etc.) are unlikely to be appropriate at the junior levels of classification. (c) Tone and impact: Curated content may be judged in its entirety from the point of view of its overall impact. The tone of content can be an important factor in deciding the influence it may have on various groups of people. Thus, films/serials that have a stronger depiction of violence may receive a higher classification. (d) Target audience: The classification of any content may also depend upon the target audience of the work and the impact of the work on such audience.

(b) Psychotropic substances, liquor, smoking and tobacco: Films or serials, etc. that as a whole portray misuse of psychotropic substances, liquor, smoking and tobacco would qualify for a higher category of classification. (c) Imitable behaviour: (1) Classification decisions may take into account any portrayal of criminal and violent behaviour with weapons. (2) Portrayal of potentially dangerous behaviour that are likely to incite the commission of any offence (including suicide, and infliction of self-harm) and that children and young people may potentially copy, shall receive a higher classification. (3) Films or serials with song and dance scenes comprising lyrics and gestures that have sexual innuendos would receive a higher classification. (d) Language: (1) Language is of particular importance, given the vast linguistic diversity of our country. The use of language, dialect, idioms and euphemisms vary from region to region and are culture-specific. This factor has to be taken into account during the process of classification of a work in a particular category. (2) Language that people may find offensive includes the use of expletives.

One hut was situated there, in which she lives and cooks and eats food at that place. At the said 2time she was alone in the hut. Her husband had gone to village Rajnagar. Accused Motilal Gadariya who was resident of same village, came there and enquired from her about her husband Barelal. She told him that he had gone to Rajnagar, and he went away. She started sweeping with broom, inside the hut. After some time, Motilal forcibly entered her hut and knocked her down on the floor. He pulled up her saree and committed sexual intercourse. She kept shouting to break free, but there was no body. Then he ran away. Being knocked down by Motilal, her bangle on the right hand had broken and ankle had bruised.

In the Indian Setting refusal to act on the testimony of the victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to injury. A girl or a woman in the tradition bound non-permissive society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect on her chastity had ever occurred. She would be conscious of the danger of being ostracized by the society and when in the face of these factors the crime is brought to light, there is inbuilt assurance that the charge is genuine rather than fabricated. Just as a witness who has sustained an injury, which is not shown or believed to be self-inflicted, is the best witness in the sense that he is least likely to exculpate the real offender, the evidence of a victim of sex offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding. A woman or a girl who is raped is not an accomplice. Corroboration is not the sine qua non for conviction in a rape case. The observations of Vivian Bose, J. in Rameshwar v. The State of Rajasthan (AIR 1952 SC 54) were: 6\u201cThe rule, which according to the cases has hardened into one of law, is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a conviction but that the necessity of corroboration, as a matter of prudence, except where the circumstances make it safe to dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge...\u201d. 7.

In normal course a victim of sexual assault does not like to disclose such offence even before her family members much less before public or before the police. The Indian women has tendency to conceal such offence because it involves her prestige as well as prestige of her family. Only in few cases, the victim girl or the family members has courage to go before the police station and lodge a case. In the instant case the suggestion given on behalf of the defence that the victim has falsely implicated the 7accused does not appeal to reasoning. There was no apparent reason for a married woman to falsely implicate the accused after scatting her own prestige and honour. 8. Of late, crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the society towards the violation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must remember that a rapist not only violates the victim's privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault -- it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female.

If for some reason the Court finds it difficult to place implicit reliance on her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the trial Court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations. This position was highlighted in State of Punjab v. Gurmeet Singh (1996 (2) SCC 384). 9. A prosecutrix of a sex-offence cannot be put on par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She 9is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the Court must be conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her.

The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full 10understanding the Court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is own to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case discloses that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the Court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. This position was highlighted in State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990 (1) SCC 550). 10. It needs no emphasis that the physical scar on a rape victim may heal up, but the mental scar will always remain. When a woman is ravished, what is inflicted is not merely physical injury but the deep sense of some deathless shame. An accused cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist on corroborative evidence, even if taken as a whole, the case spoken to by the victim strikes a judicial mind as probable.

Protection of society and deterring the criminal is the avowed object of law and that is required to be achieved by imposing an appropriate sentence. The sentencing Courts are expected to consider all relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of sentence and proceed to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offence. Courts must hear the loud cry for justice by the society in cases of the heinous crime of rape on innocent helpless girls of tender years, married women and respond by imposition of proper sentence. Public abhorrence of the crime needs reflection through imposition of appropriate sentence by the Court. There are no extenuating or mitigating circumstances available on the record which may justify 12imposition of any sentence less than the prescribed minimum.

He also pressed into service another decision of this Court in Jaswant Singh vs. State of Haryana, (2000) 4 SCC 484. 13) The following principles have to be kept in mind by the Appellate Court while dealing with appeals, particularly, against the order of acquittal: (i) There is no limitation on the part of the Appellate Court to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is found. (ii) The Appellate Court in an appeal against acquittal can review the entire evidence and come to its own conclusions. (iii) The Appellate Court can also review the Trial Court\u2019s conclusion with respect to both facts and law. (iv) While dealing with the appeal preferred by the State, it is the duty of the Appellate Court to marshal the entire evidence on record and by 20giving cogent and adequate reasons set aside the judgment of acquittal.

(vi) While sitting in judgment over an acquittal the Appellate Court is first required to seek an answer to the question whether finding of the Trial Court are palpably wrong, manifestly, erroneous or demonstrably unsustainable.

Conversely, if the Appellate Court holds, for reasons to be recorded, that the order of acquittal cannot at all be sustained in view of any of the above infirmities, it can reappraise the evidence to arrive at its own conclusion. 21(vii) When the Trial Court has ignored the evidence or misread the material evidence or has ignored material documents like dying declaration/report of Ballistic Experts etc., the Appellate Court is competent to reverse the decision of the Trial Court depending on the materials placed. In the light of the above principles, let us examine the impugned judgment of the High Court with reference to the materials placed by the prosecution and the defence. 14) At the outset, Mr. Ram Jethmalani, learned senior counsel highlighted the role of public prosecutor in conducting prosecution for which he relied on the procedures being followed in United Kingdom and also cited certain passages from the books of foreign authors.

Further, in categorical terms, he asserted and identified the presence of Manu Sharma at the scene of offence. Since he had contact with a person having fair complexion with smiling face/Manu Sharma, in the Court he correctly identified both Manu Sharma and the tall Sikh gentleman as Tony Gill.

Though, Mr. Ram Jethmalani submitted that High Court ought to have accepted his entire evidence in toto, considering his earlier statement to the police and his evidence before the Court, we are satisfied that the High Court is justified in holding that even if his testimony is discarded, the case of the prosecution hardly gets affected. As observed earlier his evidence amply proves the presence of accused at the scene of occurrence at the time and date as pleaded by the prosecution. 31c) Malini Ramani PW-6 She is the daughter of Beena Ramani PW-20.

Approximately at about 1.45 a.m., she went with her friend Sanjay Mehtani to the restaurant to look for something to eat. At that time, she had a drink in her hand.

In such circumstances, we are unable to appreciate the objection of Mr. Ram Jethmalani. On the other hand, it is clear from the evidence of PW-6 that the accused Manu Sharma was very well present at the scene of offence and she correctly identified him.

It is relevant to mention the very fact that PW-20 followed the appellant is a clear indication of the fact that she was more than certain that he was the culprit responsible for the crime, and, 50therefore, she did not chase anybody else as the person who was having the gun. It has to be borne in mind that Beena Ramani had no enmity with the appellant-Manu Sharma and also the whole theory of planting of witnesses at the instance of the police is false since the accused has not led any defence evidence or brought on record any evidence to suggest that the investigation was motivated by mala fide. 19) It was argued by the defence, since PW-47 in his cross examination has stated that Beena Ramani PW-20 stated to him as to what had happened and who had done it, an inference has to be drawn that she did not witness the incident.

A perusal of the testimony of PW-46 reveals that when he came down, PW-20 was already there. Thus PW-46 is not in a position to say as to what PW-20 witnessed. It may be further pointed out that the stairs leading to the terrace are not on the caf\u00e9 but on the main building of Qutub Colonnade which houses the shops beyond the verandah and Tamarind Court. Hence, the testimony of PW-46 cannot negate the evidence of PW- 5220 that she witnessed the incident.

In that case, application on behalf of Beena Ramani and George Mailhot was moved for seeking permission to go abroad for treatment of Beena Ramani alleging that she is a cancer patient. Mr. Jethmalani argued that notice of which was given to the State and instead of filing reply by the State 55counsel PW-101, who appeared in person, vehemently opposed on the ground that their presence may be required during the investigation of FIR No. 287 of 1999 for filing additional charge-sheet including the issue of cleaning of blood. Ultimately, the Metropolitan Magistrate rejected their application for permission and they were not allowed to go abroad because of the reason that their presence may be required for filing additional charge-sheet in FIR No. 287 of 1999. By pointing out the above information, it was argued by the learned senior counsel that the investigation agency had been pressurizing these witnesses to toe their line in their deposition in the present case, but PW-20 was not made as accused under Section 201 in the present case because they had agreed to toe the line of the prosecution but this sword was kept hanging on them to ensure that the entire family members i.e. PWs 6, 20 and 24 continue to toe the line of prosecution. All the allegations have been stoutly denied by the prosecution. It was submitted by the prosecution 56that the statement of S.I.

In her statement, before the Court PW- 20 Beena Ramani had clearly stated \u201cat the hospital, the police met me.

It was submitted by the State that this argument runs counter to the well settled proposition of law that a witness cannot be discredited without the said piece of the testimony having been put to her. The accused had a statutory option available by way of Section 311 of the Code to call PW-20 for the purposes of further examination. This argument of the defence also runs counter to their own argument used to discredit the investigation that PW-6 was placed in the \u2018rukka\u2019 by the Police for the purposes of being shown as an eye-witness.

It has been reiterated that all the three key witnesses are planted witnesses who have deposed under pressure of false implication. It has been further argued that the deposition of PW-6 that she entered the bar for a drink is improbable as she knew that the drinks were over. It is contended by the defence that PW-6 did not say that she heard the gun shots since she was inebriated, which further supports the fact that she 59could not identify anybody else. Her statement that there were four or five guys at the spot is also not corroborated by Deepak Bhojwani PW-1. The Prosecutor has put a leading question to her as to the identity of the appellant and, therefore, the said question and answer should be expunged from the record. The Police recorded a couple of her statements but the defence was not supplied with all of them.

Moreover, the excise offence is a bailable offence. Further, the statement of Malini Ramani was recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. on 03.05.99 itself vide Ex PW 6/DA and thus the contention of making her an accused on 08.05.99 on this count is also fallacious. 6026) As regards the argument that Malini Ramani PW-6 was shown as an eye-witness to the incident of shooting in the \u2018rukka\u2019, a perusal of the same reveals that at no point of time Shyan Munshi, PW-2, stated either in the positive or the negative that PW-6 was or was not there when the shots were fired. In any case, as rightly pointed out on the side of the State that the alleged prosecution planted PW-6 as an eye-witness goes contrary to all reasoning, since on 30.04.1999 at the time of recording the \u2018rukka\u2019, none of the witnesses had disclosed the identity of the appellant \u2013 Manu Sharma, therefore, to allege that the Police had planted the witness is wholly incorrect. 27) As regards the argument that PW-6 was under the influence of alcohol, therefore, could not have identified the appellant \u2013 Manu Sharma, is also wrong since she clearly stated in her testimony, particularly, in cross- examination, that she had consumed only one drink. 28) The argument that deposition of PW-6 as regards the presence of other accused, does not find corroboration 61from the testimony of PW-1 is incorrect since the said witness categorically mentioned the presence of other accused.

Further the argument of her having been shown the photo her identification is of little value since her statement that she saw the photographs prior to 05.05.1999 is most wavering and unclear. In the same manner, she has deposed that photos were also shown to Beena Ramani PW-20 and 62George Mailhot PW-24 is of little value since neither PW- 20 nor PW-24 stated that they had been shown the photos of the accused in spite of having all the opportunities failed to confront the said witnesses with the said part of PW-6\u2019s testimony. Based on the statement of Rohit Bal PW-70, that he saw her screaming out, the defence has sought to discredit PW-6\u2019s, statement. It is relevant to note that it is the case of PW-6 that she came to know when she was in the courtyard, Shyan Munshi came running towards her and Sanjay Mehtani, screaming that Jessica Lal had been shot. Thereafter, PW-6 fainted, thus, in the process, if PW-70 saw her screaming in the courtyard, it cannot be said that there is any contradiction in the statement of PW-6 and PW-70. 29) It was pointed out by the defence that the firing was not over a drink, the act to refuse supply of", "index": 41, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "liquor was not the motive to murder Jessica.

As rightly pointed out by the State that it was a case where the deceased Jessica Lal was murdered for a row over the drink. 30) It was also pointed out on the side of the appellant- Manu Sharma, that the evidence of Malini Ramani, PW-6 and George Mailhot, PW-24 does not corroborate the statement of Beena Ramani, PW-20. In this regard, it is relevant to note that these three witnesses have deposed on three different situations in the chain of circumstances. The evidence of these three witnesses, if read in whole in conjunction and in harmony with each other, would show the chain of circumstances of evidence leading to only one inference. It was highlighted by the defence that PWs 46 & 47 stated that they did not see PW- 24 after the party was over at 12.30 a.m. By saying so, it was contended that PW-24 was never there at the time of the alleged incident. It was also contended that PW-24 reached the Mehrauli police station at around 2.25 a.m. 64whereas if the story of the prosecution is true then he should have reached around 2.10 a.m. It is relevant to mention that PW-24\u2019s statement was recorded on the same day i.e. 30.04.99. The presence of PW-24 at the time of incident is also supported by the testimony of ASI Kartar Singh PW-13, who deposed that a person bearing the description of PW-24 came to the Police Station to report about the firing incident, which fact corroborates the testimony of PW-24 that he went to", "index": 42, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "the Police Station. It was urged by Mr. Ram Jethmalani that Rohit Bal PW-70 was a witness who have been examined first as his telephone number appears on Ex. PW-12/D1 which are the PCR messages. It was clarified that in the PCR only the mobile number was recorded. Further on receipt of information, police officers immediately reached the place of occurrence and came to know that the deceased had been taken to Ashlok Hospital. SI Sunil Kumar, PW-100 reached Ashlok Hospital and made enquiries from PW-20 who directed him to take the statement of Shyan Munshi 65as he was present at the bar counter and conversant with every thing.

The said claim of the prosecution cannot be rejected as unreasonable. 31) In the earlier part of our judgment, we have noted that PW-20 has categorically stated that she heard the two shots, saw the people inside and Jessica falling down, which shows that she had witnessed the entire incident as is evident from the relevant portion of her testimony extracted in paragraphs supra.

Sharma PW-9, who conducted post-mortem on the body of deceased Jessica Lal has stated that on 30.04.1999 at about 11:20 a.m. 7 sheets of papers i.e. inquest papers, request of post-mortem, inquest report, copy of FIR, brief facts of the case, were submitted to him along with the dead body. He informed that the cause of death to the best of his knowledge and belief was head injury due to firearm, injury was ante-mortem in nature. He also deposed that Injury no. 3 was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. 6733) Coming to the evidentiary value of PW-2, on behalf of the defence, it was stated that PW-2 is not a reliable witness in view of the fact that according to him he made his statement in English, however, SI Sunil Kumar recorded it in Hindi. In the absence of any suggestion to the contrary, as rightly pointed out by the counsel for the State that it must be presumed that PW-100 recorded the statement correctly. It is also relevant to mention that in his statement as a witness he said \u201cI can understand spoken Hindi. Hindi was my third language when I was studying in the seventh standard.

Thus, reliance could have been placed only on that aspect of the testimony which is corroborated by other evidence on record. 34) With regard to the allegation that statements of PW-6, PW-20 and PW-24 were taken under pressure as a case under Excise Act was lodged against them and when they were to be examined, an application for pre-ponement of the case was moved where they pleaded guilty and fine of Rs. 200 was imposed on each. For this, it was pointed out that there is nothing on record to suggest that PW-6 was threatened or humiliated by the Police or that she would be implicated in a case of destroying the evidence i.e. removal of blood from the spot. In fact, PW-20 has denied the suggestion that she is deposing falsely at the instance of Police. In the same way, PW-24 has also denied the suggestion that a deal was struck between him and the investigation agency to make a false statement, thereafter, the Excise case could be hatched up. It is relevant to 69point out that the case under Punjab Excise Act which was registered as FIR No. 288/99 on 30.04.1999 has not been withdrawn by the prosecution against the accused. On the other hand, the fact remained that the accused had pleaded guilty.

In those circumstances, the allegation that these three witnesses were kept under pressure is not acceptable. 70What constitutes the First Information Report 35) Let us consider whether the three telephonic messages received by the Police at around 2:25 a.m. on 30.04.1999 or the statement made by Shyan Munshi recorded at Ashlok Hospital constitute the FIR. It is the submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant-Manu Sharma that the statement of Rohit Bal PW-70 ought to have been used for the purpose of registration of FIR instead of Shyan Munshi PW-2. It was demonstrated that Rohit Bal had made two calls on \u2018100\u2019 on coming to know by other persons that Jessica Lal has been shot inside the caf\u00e9. As against this, Shyan Munshi PW-2 was very much within the vicinity of the place of occurrence and, therefore, the statement of Shyan Munshi was used for the purpose of registration of FIR. It is relevant to point out that PW-70 has never claimed to have witnessed the incident. He confirmed his presence on the spot and having seen PW-20 accosting a man. 7136) It was further contended by the learned senior counsel for the appellant-accused that PW-2 Shyan Munshi\u2019s statement could not be looked into as the same is hit by Section 162 Cr.P.C. and on the other hand the defence seeks to rely on his testimony. In support of the above claim, the learned senior counsel", "index": 46, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "for the appellant relying upon the judgments of this Court in State of U.P. vs. Bhagwant Kishore Joshi AIR 1964 SC 221 and Emperor vs. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad AIR 1945 PC 18 contended that investigation of an offence can start either on information or otherwise and that the receipt and recording of FIR is not a condition precedent to the setting in motion of criminal investigation. Placing reliance upon the said judgments, it has been further argued by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that in the present case the three cryptic telephonic messages received by the Police at around 2.20 a.m. on 30.04.1999 should be treated as FIR upon which the investigation started and, therefore, the statement of PW-2 recorded by 72the Police later on around 3.40 a.m. could not be treated as FIR but a statement under Section 162 of Cr.P.C. 37) Insofar as the decision in Bhagwant Kishore (supra), it was noted in para 8 at page 224 that the information received by the officer was not vague, but contained precise particulars of the acts of misappropriation committed by the accused and, therefore, the said information could be treated as FIR. On the contrary, it is evident from the facts established on record in the present case that none of the three telephonic messages received by police furnished any detail about the offence or the accused. The judgment in Khwaja Nazir Ahmad (supra) is also distinguishable as the law laid down in the said case does not concern the issue involved in the present case. Cryptic telephonic messages could not be treated as FIR as their object only is to get the police to the scene of offence and not to register the FIR. The said intention can also be clearly culled out from a bare", "index": 47, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "reading of Section 154 of the 73Criminal Procedure Code which states that the information, if given orally, should be reduced in writing, read over to the informant, signed by the informant and a copy of the same be given free of cost to the informant. In the case on hand, the object of persons sending the telephonic messages including PW-70 Rohit Bal was only to bring the police to the scene of offence and not to register the FIR. Learned senior counsel for the accused- Manu Sharma has also relied upon a judgment of this Court in H.N. Rishbud & Inder Singh vs. The State of Delhi (1955) SCR 1150 wherein this Court has held that investigation usually starts on information relating to commission of an offence given to an officer in-charge of a police station and recorded under Section 154 of the Code. A reading of the said judgment clearly shows that investigation starts on information relating to commission of an offence given to an officer in charge of a police station and recorded under Section 154 of the Code. By applying the ratio of the said judgment to the case on 74hand, it can be clearly said that the investigation started after the recording of the statement of PW 2 as FIR around 3.40 a.m. on 30.04.1999. 38) Learned senior counsel for the appellant also relied on judgment of the Gujarat High Court in Mehr Vajsi Deva vs. State of Gujarat, AIR 1965 Guj 143. A perusal of the said judgment shows that the details of the offence given by the telephonic message in the said judgment clearly described that \u2018one man was assaulted by means of an axe at Sudama Chowk\u2019, on the other hand, in the case on hand the telephonic message did not give any", "index": 48, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "details of the offence or accused and the same was a vague information.

In the said case, detailed information was given on telephone including the offence and the whereabouts of the accused. On the other hand, in the present case, as observed earlier all the three telephone calls barely mentioned that a fire was shot and a girl was killed. The said information could only be concluded to have been given to the police to get the police to the scene of offence and not with the object of registering FIR. In those circumstances, the judgment in Tapan Kumar Singh (supra) has no application to the facts of the case on hand. 40) It was further pointed out by the defence that Ex.P- 12/A wherein three PCR calls were recorded is the real FIR and the statement of PW-2 which was taken during investigation and got signed by him is not the FIR and is thus to be treated as a statement recorded under Section 76161 Cr.P.C. and is hit by the bar under Section 162 Cr.P.C.

Madhu, (1984) 4 SCC 83 wherein this Court has not accepted a similar argument and held as under:- 5. To begin with, it appears that there was some dispute about the dearness allowance claim of the labour from the management which was referred to the Industrial Tribunal. The respondent, who was the Secretary of the Union, was looking after the case on behalf of the workers, while PWs 5 and 7 were the officers appearing on behalf of the management before the Tribunal. The deceased, S.J. Sirgaonkar, was Deputy Personnel Manager of the Bombay Branch of M/s Hindustan Construction Company. He was shot dead by the respondent after he (deceased), along with the other officers of the management, had come out of the Tribunal\u2019s office at Meerut after filing their written statements. Thereafter one of the eyewitnesses, S.K. Gui (PW 7) asked someone to give a telephone call to the police station, which was nearby, on receipt of which the police arrived at the spot, seized the pistol and took the accused and some of the witnesses to the police station where a formal FIR was registered. The Panchnama was prepared and other formalities were, however, done at the spot. 11. Durga Das, DW 1 who was admittedly at the scene of the occurrence has stated that as the shooting started, PW 7 had given a telephonic message to the police station. The High Court by an implied process of reasoning has observed that if PW 7 had given the telephonic message he would have mentioned the name 77of the assailant because he was a full-fledged eye- witness but since his name had not been mentioned it is the strongest possible", "index": 50, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "circumstance to discredit the prosecution case. We are, however, unable to agree with this somewhat involved reasoning of the High Court. In fact, DW 1 merely says that Gui telephoned to the police station about the firing and said something in English. The High Court seems to have presumed that from this the irresistible inference to be drawn is that Gui did not mention the name of the assailant of the deceased and on this ground alone the prosecution must fail. This argument is based on a serious error. In the first place, the telephonic message was an extremely cryptic one and could not be regarded as an FIR in any sense of the term. Secondly, assuming that Gui had given the telephonic message in utter chaos and confusion when shots after shots were being fired at the deceased, there was no occasion for Gui to have narrated the entire story of the occurrence. In fact, in his evidence Gui has denied that he personally telephoned the police but he stated that he asked somebody to telephone the police which appears to be both logical and natural. Moreover, such a cryptic information on telephone has been held by this Court to be of no value at all. In Tapinder Singh v.

It was argued and highlighted that since PW-2 Shyan Munshi has been confronted with his signed statement i.e. Ex.PW-2/A and B, the whole evidence goes in light of Zahidurddin vs. Emperor, AIR 1947 PC 75. Apart from the above decision reliance has further been placed on Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs to the State of W.B. vs. Ram Ajudhya Singh & Anr. AIR 1965 Cal. 348 (Para 9) and Mer Vas Deva vs. State of Gujarat, AIR 1965 Guj. 143 (Para 9 & 10). We have carefully perused those decisions. We are satisfied that nothing turns on this argument since the said decisions only provide that where a statement made/given by a witness under Section 161 of the Code and signed by the same is hit by the bar prescribed under Section 162 of the Code, but nowhere do they say that the evidence deposed to in Court by the said witness becomes admissible.

That necessarily meant that Ext. 10/1 was a statement made to a police officer during investigation which could not be read for any purpose except for contradicting the maker thereof in view of Section 162(1) of the Code, argued Mr Jethmalani. In support of his contention Mr Jethmalani relied upon the judgment of the Privy Council in Zahiruddin v. Emperor. It appears that the question as to whether Ext. 10/1 could be treated as an FIR was raised both before the trial court and the High Court and it was answered in the affirmative. The courts held that in the night of 11-11-1985, PW 96 did not examine any witness in connection with the incident that took place in that afternoon and, in fact, he did not take any step towards the investigation as he and other police officers were busy in maintaining law and order in the village. 38.

In cross-examination it was elicited from him that on the very night he learnt that houses of some people had been looted and set on fire, some people had been murdered and that some villagers were untraceable. While being further cross-examined he volunteered that 80he had started the investigation of the case registered over the second incident in the same night. In the face of such admissions of PW 96 and the various steps of investigation he took in connection with the second incident there cannot be any escape from the conclusion that the report lodged by PC PW 1 on the following morning could only be treated as a statement recorded in accordance with Section 161(3) of the Code and not as an FIR. The next question, therefore is whether the evidence of PC PW 1 is inadmissible as contended by Mr Jethmalani. 39. In the case of Zahiruddin the police had got the statement of the principal witness which was, admittedly, recorded during investigation signed by him. Besides, during trial, while being examined-in-chief he refreshed his memory from that statement. The trial ended in an acquittal with a finding that when a police officer obtains a signed statement from a witness in contravention of Section 162 of the Criminal Procedure Code his evidence must be rejected. In appeal the High Court set aside the order of acquittal holding that breaches of the provisions of Section 162 Criminal Procedure Code were not in themselves necessarily fatal to the proceedings and might in appropriate circumstances be cured as the expression was under the terms", "index": 54, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "of Section 537 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (Section 465 of the Code). In setting aside the order of the High Court the Privy Council observed as under: \u201c... the effect of a contravention of the section depends on the prohibition which has been contravened. If the contravention consists in the signing of a statement made to the police and reduced into writing, the evidence of the witness who signed it does not become inadmissible. There are no words either in the section or elsewhere in the statute which express or imply such a consequence. Still less can it be said that the statute has the effect of vitiating the whole proceedings when evidence is given by a witness who has signed such a statement. But the value of his evidence may be seriously impaired as a consequence of the contravention of this statutory safeguard against improper practices. The use by a witness while he is giving evidence of a statement made by him to the police raises different considerations. The categorical prohibition of such use would be merely disregarded if reliance were to be placed on the evidence of a witness who had made material use of the statement when he 81was giving evidence at the trial. When, therefore, the Magistrate or presiding Judge discovers that a witness has made material use of such a statement it is his duty under the section to disregard the evidence of that witness as inadmissible. In the present case there is in the note at the end of Mr Roy\u2019s examination-in-chief and, in the judgment of the Magistrate what amounts to a finding of fact that Mr Roy while giving his evidence made substantial and material use of the signed statement given by him to the police, and the Magistrate was", "index": 55, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "accordingly bound to disregard his evidence. The Magistrate\u2019s reason for doing so is too broadly stated, for it is not the mere fact that Mr Roy had signed the statement but the fact that he had it before him and consulted it in the witness box that renders his evidence incompetent.\u201d (emphasis supplied) 40. In our considered view the above-quoted passage is of no assistance to the appellants herein for in the instant case after PC PW 1 testified about the incident, prosecution got the statement of PC PW 1 exhibited Ext. 10/1 as according to it Ext. 10/1 was the FIR. Such a course was legally permissible to the prosecution to corroborate the witness in view of Section 157 of the Evidence Act. Of course in a given case \u2014 as in the present one \u2014 the court may on the basis of subsequent materials hold that the statement so recorded could not be treated as the FIR and exclude the same from its consideration as a piece of corroborative evidence in view of Section 162 of the Code but then on that score alone the evidence of a witness cannot be held to be inadmissible. The case of Zahiruddin turned on its own facts, particularly the fact that during his examination- in-chief the witness was allowed to refresh his memory from the statement recorded under Section 161 Criminal Procedure Code, unlike the present one where the statement was admitted in evidence after PC PW 1 had testified about the facts from his own memory.\u201d 41) The information about the commission of a cognizable offence given \u201cin person at the Police Station\u201d and the information about a cognizable offence given \u201con telephone\u201d have forever been treated by this Court on different pedestals.

Identifying the said objective difference between the two situations, this Court has categorically held in a plethora of judgments that a cryptic telephonic message of a cognizable offence cannot be treated as a First Information Report under the Code. It has also been held in a number of judgments by this Court that merely because the information given on phone was prior in time would not mean that the same would be treated as the First Information Report, as understood under the Code. This view has been reiterated in Ramesh Baburao Devaskar and Others vs. State of Maharashtra (2007) 13 SCC 501, that a cryptic message 83given on telephone by somebody who does not disclose his identity may not satisfy the requirement of Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 42) In view of the above discussion, the three telephonic messages received by the police around 2.25 a.m. on 30.04.1999 did not constitute the FIR under Section 154 of the Code and the statement of Shyan Munshi PW-2 was rightly registered as the FIR. 42A) Seizure of Tata Safari & broken glass pieces and live cartridge: (i) The testimony of PW-30 has proved the presence of Tata Safari CH-01-W-6535 at the spot after the incident which testimony is duly corroborated by PW-83, PW-78, PW-100 and PW-101 and by documents Ex PW 101/DK-1, which shows about the PCR message", "index": 57, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "about this vehicle at 6.00 a.m. on 30.04.1999.

In this regard reliance may be placed on Sucha Singh vs. State of Punjab (2001) 4 SCC 375 at page 381: \u201cIt is pointed out that Section 106 of the Evidence Act is not intended to relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, but the section would apply to cases where the prosecution has succeeded in proving facts for which a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts, unless the accused by 104virtue of special knowledge regarding such facts failed to offer", "index": 70, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "any explanation which might drive the court to draw a different inference\u201d In addition, the prosecution by way of acceptable evidence has proved beyond reasonable doubt that: a) Manu Sharma accused was the owner and possessed .22\u201d P.

The defence filed a reply to the said application on the same day i.e., 07.05.1999 and thereupon the Metropolitan Magistrate passed an order on the same day granting seven days police custody of the accused for recovery of pistol. The accused despite forever maintaining that the police had illegally taken away the pistol from his farmhouse on 30.04.1999/01.05.1999, did not take this ground in the reply to remand application and argument to the said effect was recorded in the 107remand order by the Magistrate. The only inevitable conclusion that could be reached from the said turn of events is that the pistol was still in custody of the accused and had never been recovered by the police from his farmhouse. In the reply dated 07.05.1999 filed by the accused to the remand application, there are interpolations in the reply in black ink in two handwritings to the effect that the pistol had already been recovered from the person of the accused.

It is pointed out by the learned Solicitor General that the Courts below ought to have drawn an adverse inference from the said facts but have failed to do so. Thus this evidence coupled with the testimony of Shyan Munshi, PW-2, that the person in white T-shirt who was asking for whisky took out a pistol from dub of his 108pant and fired a shot in the air and the other witnesses PWs 1,6, 20 and 24 that the person in white T-shirt was Manu Sharma, a positive inference beyond reasonable doubt has to be drawn that Manu Sharma fired from his .22\u201d bore pistol which resulted in the death of Jessica Lal on the fateful night of 29/30.04.1999. 57) Mr. Ram Jethmalani, learned senior counsel, appearing for the accused pointed out that no question has been put to the accused in his examination under Section 313 Cr.P.C. with reference to the pistol and shooting by him for this.

What you have to say in this regard? Ans. It is false and incorrect. Q.66 It is further in evidence of PW 20 that she asked you Manu Sharma again but you kept quiet and shaking your hands that it was not him and thereafter you pushed her aside and went out and she ran after you but should could not catch you.

It is absolutely false and incorrect.\u201d A perusal of above questions and answers given by Manu Sharma were either evasive or incorrect and as rightly pointed out by the learned Solicitor General, an adverse inference deserves to be drawn for such acts of the appellant-Manu Sharma. The implication of delay in recording statements 58) Mr. Ram Jethmalani, learned senior counsel for the appellant-Manu Sharma by placing various decision contended that the delay in recording statements of witnesses is fatal to the case of the prosecution, when the trial Court rightly accepted the same, however, the High 110Court committed an error in ignoring the said vital aspect. For this, learned Solicitor General submitted that the said contention is", "index": 74, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "based on incorrect understanding of law and its wrong application to the facts of this case. The first judgment relied on by the learned senior counsel for the appellant-Manu Sharma is in Ganesh Bhavan Patel vs. State of Maharashtra, (1978) 4 SCC 371. In that case, the witnesses were known and could have been examined when the Investigating Officer visited the scene of occurrence or soon thereafter. In the present case, there were about 100 or more persons present at the party. The identity of all such persons took substantial amount of time to determine. Consequent to the large number of witnesses, their interrogation also consequently took a substantial amount of time. Unlike the said decision, in the present case, there are no concomitant circumstances to suggest that the investigator was deliberately making time with a view to give a particular shape to the case. The details of investigation conducted on each day are 111very clearly brought out in the evidence of the various witnesses. Furthermore, the identity of the appellant as a suspect in the present case was not the consequence of any delay. Thus, the delay, if any, in recording the evidence of witnesses in the present case cannot be considered as an infirmity in the prosecution case. 59) The judgment in Maruti Rama Naik vs. State of Mahrashtra, (2003) 10 SCC 670, relied on is also distinguishable. The delay in recording the statement in that case was coupled with the unnatural conduct of the witness and that was what made the evidence of the said witness unreliable, which is not so in the present case. 60) The other judgment in Jagjit Singh vs. State of Punjab (2005) 3 SCC 689 is also distinguishable. In that case, the delay in recording the evidence of PW-6 was coupled with", "index": 75, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "several other factors which made her testimony unreliable, including the finding that she implicated the appellant only at the prompting of her father and that otherwise she had not named the 112appellant as an accused. Furthermore, there was no explanation regarding the delay in that case. The facts of that case are, therefore, clearly different from the present case. 61) The defence seeks to discredit the statement of PW-1 Deepak Bhojwani on two counts, firstly that statement is recorded after 14 days and secondly, there are various improvements, in his statement. It is next contended by the defence to believe this man is to disbelieve Beena Ramani. According to him, the prosecution did not know even on 14.05.1999 the details of their story and thus resulting in various improvements in the testimony of this witness, in the witness box. This contention of the defence looses sight of the fact that much prior to 14.05.1999 Manu Sharma had surrendered on 06.05.1999 and had made his disclosures and thus there could be no question of not knowing the facts on 14.05.1999. Had the witnesses been planted, the witnesses would have rendered a parrot like testimony. 113PW-1 has explicitly stated that on 30.04.1999 he had told the police at the Apollo Hospital all that he knew. This being the case, it cannot be said that the testimony of the witness should be thrown out for the delay in recording the statement by the Police. Clearly, PW-1 was not an eye witness, this fact must have been realized by PW-100 and 101, therefore, they felt no urgency in addressing this aspect of the investigation i.e., recording of the statement of PW-1. It is stated by the State that as there were number of witnesses to be examined the said examination continued for days.

Further the presence of Deepak Bhojwani can also not be belied in view of the testimony of Sahana Mukherjee PW- 29 and Sabrina Lal PW-73. In any case, any defect by delay in examination of witnesses in the manner of investigation cannot be a ground to condemn the witness. Further Section 162 Cr.P.C. is very clear that it is not mandatory for the police to record every statement. In 114other words, law contemplates a situation where there might be witnesses who depose in Court but whose previous statements have not been recorded. 62) It is next contended by the learned senior counsel for the appellant-Manu Sharma that there was a delay in recording the statement of Deepak Bhojwani and his name having not been found from the list of guests prepared by George Mailhot, Ex. 24/A. It was further pointed out that the list was not a conclusive list and was prepared by George Mailhot on the basis of remembrance and other witnesses have also admitted the presence of Deepak Bhojwani. This is more so relevant as the invited guests were also entitled to bring guests with them. The statements of witnesses were recorded not only by the I.O. himself but by other officials as well who were helping him in investigation. The delay in recording the statement of Deepak Bhojwani occurred due to natural flow of statements of various witnesses. The statement of Deepak Bhojwani PW-1, was recorded by ACP Durga 115Prasad PW-92, who stated the name of Deepak Bhojwani occurred during the course of interrogation of other guests/witnesses.

I did not make any statement to the police in Apollo Hospital.

PW 89/DB. It has been further argued that while the charge sheet was filed on 03.08.1999, the police sought an expert opinion practically at the end of the investigation i.e. vide letter dated 16.07.1999, Ex. PW-89/DA. At Sl. 120No. 67 of the charge sheet one finds mention of the letters sent by the SHO seeking the expert opinion. The charge sheet was filed without the expert opinion. The accused on seeing Sl. No.67, approached the committal Court and asked for the expert report. It has been argued that the I.O. had received the opinion in the first week of December, 1999 but did not file the same. On 21.12.1999, the Court directed the prosecution to file the report. The SPP objected to the same on the ground that the order required modification but the same was rejected and on 14.01.2000, the Court again directed supply of the expert report. It has been argued that since the report did not favour the prosecution, the same was withheld. It has been further argued by the defence that failure on the part of the prosecution to bring on record material which is in favour of the accused is a breach of Article 21 of the Constitution. It has been argued by the", "index": 81, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "defence that it was improper on the part of the prosecution to condemn a ballistic expert, i.e., Rup Singh without calling him in for 121cross-examination.

The expert evidence is only good if it appeals to the judicial lines; appreciation of such evidence can only be the work of the Court. Reliance has been placed on A.E.G. Carapiet vs. A.Y. Derderian, AIR 1961 Calcutta 359 paras 10-14 to assert that every witness must be cross-examined before being discredited. The prosecution cannot challenge the expert at the stage of appeal when his testimony went unchallenged at the stage of the trial. 67) It has been argued that the Court must lay down in clear terms the duties of a public prosecutor i.e., to tell the truth even if the same is in favour of the accused. Reliance has been placed on Rule 16 of the Bar Council of India Rules which 122are to the said effect. Reliance is further placed on Attorney Generals Guidelines contained in Archbold Criminal pleadings edition 2003 to say that it is obligatory on the part of the prosecution to disclose all the material. It has been argued that even after an application under Section 391 Cr.P.C. has been filed, the prosecution still chose not to call the expert Rup Singh and cross-examine him.

The said witness obliged them and created confusion by saying that no conclusive opinion can be given without examining the weapon in question. 67) It was pointed out by the State that the said report of Rup Singh is inadmissible in law since it is a photocopy and, therefore, does not fall within the purview of a report 123in terms of Section 293 of the Code. In other words, in terms of the relevant provisions of the Indian Evidence Act unless the original document is placed for the scrutiny of the Court, no reliance can be placed on the photocopy without leading proper secondary evidence in this regard.

This opinion of the expert was vague and on the basis of said opinion no credence can be lent to the fact adverted to by the defence that there were two persons who fired two different shots from two different weapons. Moreover the said report is oddly silent on query No.7 of the forwarding letter wherein it was specifically asked about the various markings on the live cartridge and the bullet empties. The stand of the defence that to opine the two cartridge cases are from the same weapon or not the pistol is not required and the pistol is only required when the opinion is sought whether they are from that particular weapon or not cannot be accepted. It is well settled that when pressure is built 125inside the cartridge case, which results in the pushing out of the bullet from the barrel, there is difference in the marks to the extent that it may be either clear or unclear and flattened or deepened thus no opinion can be rendered on account of this dissimilarity in the absence of the weapon of offence and test firing. Further once the report of Rup Singh is rendered inadmissible the two gun theory of the defence becomes wholly inadmissible and what remains is that the two empties found at the spot are .22\u201d bore cartridges, that the live bullet found in the Tata Safari is a .22\u201d cartridge and that the gun belonging to the appellant is a .22\u201d bore pistol which was used for the commission", "index": 84, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "of the crime of murder of Jessica Lal. 68) The prosecution obtained another opinion from FSL Rajasthan and the queries made are as under: \u201c1.

The argument that the judge knew that the issue in question was whether the two empties found on the spot were fired from the same gun is wrong and misleading. The judge knew that as per the charge framed against Manu Sharma it was he alone who was charged with the possession and use of a gun. The judge also knew that the first expert opinion was brought on record at the instance of the accused; the judge further knew that PW-95 had stated in no uncertain terms that no opinion can be given as regards the two empties without receipt of the weapon of offence.

The fact that the I.O. sought to mention at S.No. 67 of the list of documents in the Charge Sheet about the forwarding letter to the expert only suggests that the prosecution had no intention of carrying out the act of seeking an expert opinion, is hiding. The discretion on the part of the I.O. and the superior officers was rightly exercised when they decided not to file the expert report 131since they realized that the expert report is ambiguous as it uses the term \u201cappear\u201d when it suggests that the two empties appear to have been fired from different weapons. Clearly the said opinion was far from conclusive and would have only created confusion in the case of the prosecution. Thereafter a second opinion was sought wherein the expert i.e. PW-95 opined that a conclusive opinion can only be given after the receipt of the weapon of offence. The argument that the weapon of offence is not required to determine whether the two bullets have been fired from the same gun is based", "index": 88, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "on the wrong premise that the two empties would necessarily consist of features which would enable an expert in determining the said fact. For instance, as in the case of a handwriting expert who has to give an opinion about two different sets of near identical questioned documents and as to whether the same belong to different persons, if the argument of the accused has to be accepted then the expert should be able to give such an opinion without having in his possession 132the specimen handwriting and the admitted handwriting of the accused. It is stated that such an approach would render the opinion as that of a layman and not an expert. Similar would be case of a finger print expert who undertakes the process of discovering two different sets of finger print which are in question, without having the specimen or the admitted finger print of the accused in question. In other words, an expert is only an expert if he follows the well accepted guidelines to arrive at a conclusion and supports the same with logical reasoning which is a requirement of law as laid down in the Indian Evidence Act. In the present case, the moment Rup Singh uses the word \u201cappear\u201d his opinion unsupported by reasons becomes inconclusive and stands discredited for the purpose of placing reliance on. The opinion of Rup Singh was at query No.7 as to \u201cplease examine and opine whether ejector, trigger, chamber, magazine or other tool marks are present on the live bullet and the bullet empties contained in parcel Nos. 6 & 5 respectively.\u201d Though Shri 133Rup Singh has given opinion qua query No.5 that the two .22\u201d cartridge cases appears to have been fired from two different .22\u201d caliber standard firearms but his opinion is completely silent", "index": 89, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "on the marks i.e. ejector, trigger, chamber, magazine or other tool marks on the bullet empties (Ex. PW 89/DB). Clearly an option was available to the accused under Section 293 Cr.P.C. to call for the witness and ascertain from his for sure that the two empties were in fact fire from two different weapons, however, the accused did not choose to do so in terms of Section 293 Cr.P.C. In any case, the opinion of Rup Singh as of today is of little use to the accused for the reasons stated above and since it is both inconclusive and unsupported by any reasoning whatsoever and, therefore, cannot appeal to the judicial mind of this Court. Similar is the case with the expert opinion of PW-95 which is again inconclusive. There is no evidence on record to suggest that PW-95 gave an opinion to oblige the prosecution. On the contrary, his response to the Court 134question reveals that he was extremely confused as to the issue which had to be addressed by him in the capacity of an expert. In the concluding part of his testimony he reaffirms the opinion given by him which is that without test firing the empties from the weapon of offence no conclusive opinion can be given. 72) It is pertinent to note that the testimony of the experts i.e., Rup Singh exhibited as Ex.PW-89/DB and PW-95 Prem Sagar Minocha exhibited as Wx PW-95/C-1 in inconclusive. The expert PW-95 Prem Sagar Minocha has stated in his report that it is only on receiving the weapon of offence that a conclusive opinion as to whether the two empties (cartridge cases) found at the spot were fired from the same weapon or from two different weapons could be given. 73) The defence seeks to reply upon the testimony", "index": 90, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "of PW- 2 with regard to the two gun theory put forward. In this regard, the defence seeks to corroborate the said part of PW-2\u2019s testimony with the testimony of the two ballistic 135experts. It has also been contended by the defence that the testimony of a hostile witness must be corroborated by the other reliable evidence on record in order to be admissible. The law is very clear that where a witness for the prosecution turns hostile, the Court may rely upon so much of the testimony, which supports the case of the prosecution and is corroborated by other evidence. PW- 2\u2019s testimony as regards the identity of the person shooting, is certainly not corroborated by the testimony of the experts since both the experts have given opinions which cannot qualify as conclusive opinion of experts. Role of Public Prosecutor and his duty of disclosure: 74) It was argued by Mr. Ram Jethmalani, learned senior counsel for the appellant-Manu Sharma that the prosecutor had suppressed vital evidence relating to the laboratory reports which were useful for the defence in order to establish the innocence of the accused. Learned senior counsel further argued that the prosecutor had not 136complied with his duty thus violating fair trial and vitiating the trial itself. 75) It is thus important for us to address the role of a prosecutor, disclosure requirements if placed by the prosecutor and the role of a judge in a criminal trial. 76) A public prosecutor is appointed under Section 24 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thus, Public Prosecutor is a statutory office of high regard. This Court has observed the role of a prosecutor in Shiv Kumar v. Hukam Chand and Anr., (1999) 7 SCC 467 as follows: \u201c13. From the scheme of the Code the legislative intention", "index": 91, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "is manifestly clear that prosecution in a Sessions Court cannot be conducted by any one other than the Public Prosecutor. The legislature reminds the State that the policy must strictly conform to fairness in the trial of an accused in a Sessions Court. A Public Prosecutor is not expected to show a thirst to reach the case in the conviction of the accused somehow or the other irrespective of the true facts involved in the case. The expected attitude of the Public Prosecutor while conducting prosecution must be couched in fairness not only to the Court and to the investigating agencies but to the accused as well. If an accused is entitled to any legitimate benefit during trial the Public Prosecutor should not scuttle/conceal it. On the contrary, it is the duty of the Public Prosecutor to winch it to the force and make it available to the accused. Even if the defence counsel overlooked it, Public Prosecutor has the added responsibility to bring it to the notice of the Court if it comes to his knowledge, A private counsel, if allowed frees hand to conduct prosecution would focus on bringing the case to conviction even if it is not a fit case to be so convicted. That is the reason why Parliament applied a bridle on him and 137subjected his role strictly to the instructions given by the Public Prosecutor.\u201d This Court has also held that the prosecutor does not represent the investigation agencies, but the State. This Court in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur and Others v. State of Maharashtra and Others, (1994) 4 SCC 602 held: \u201c22. \u2026 A public prosecutor is an important officer of the State Govt. and is appointed by the State under the CrPC. He is not a part of the investigating agency. He is", "index": 92, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "an independent statutory authority. The public prosecutor is expected to independently apply his mind to the request of the investigating agency before submitting a report to the court for extension of time with a view to enable the investigating agency to complete the investigation. He is not merely a post office or a forwarding agency. A public prosecutor may or may not agree with the reasons given by the investigating officer for seeking extension of time and may find that the investigation had not progressed in the proper manner or that there has been unnecessary, deliberate or avoidable delay in completing the investigation\u201d Therefore, a public prosecutor has wider set of duties than to merely ensure that the accused is punished, the duties of ensuring fair play in the proceedings, all relevant facts are brought before the court in order for the determination of truth and justice for all the parties including the victims. It must be noted that these duties do not allow 138the prosecutor to be lax in any of his duties as against the accused. 77) It is also important to note the active role which is to be played by a court in a criminal trial. The court must ensure that the prosecutor is doing his duties to the utmost level of efficiency and fair play. This Court, in Zahira Habibulla H. Sheikh and Anr. v. State of Gujarat and Ors., (2004) 4 SCC 158, has noted the daunting task of a court in a criminal trial while noting the most pertinent provisions of the law. It is useful to reproduce the passage in full: \u201c43. The Courts have to take a participatory role in a trial. They are not expected to be tape recorders to record whatever is being stated by the witnesses. Section 311", "index": 93, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "of the Code and Section 165 of the Evidence Act confer vast and wide powers on Presiding Officers of Court to elicit all necessary materials by playing an active role in the evidence collecting process. They have to monitor the proceedings in aid of justice in a manner that something, which is not relevant, is not unnecessarily brought into record. Even if the prosecutor is remiss in some ways, it can control the proceedings effectively so that ultimate objective i.e. truth is arrived at. This becomes more necessary the Court has reasons to believe that the prosecuting agency or the prosecutor is not acting in the requisite manner. The Court cannot afford to be wishfully or pretend to be blissfully ignorant or oblivious to such serious pitfalls or dereliction of duty on the part of the prosecuting agency. The prosecutor who does not act fairly and acts more like a counsel for the defence is a liability to the fair judicial system, and Courts 139could not also play into the hands of such prosecuting agency showing indifference or adopting an attitude of total aloofness. 44. The power of the Court under Section 165 of the Evidence Act is in a way complementary to its power under Section 311 of the Code. The section consists of two parts i.e. (i) giving a discretion to the Court to examine the witness at any stage and (ii) the mandatory portion which compels the Courts to examine a witness if his evidence appears to be essential to the just decision of the Court. Though the discretion given to the Court is very wide, the very width requires a corresponding caution. In Mohan Lal v. Union of India,this Court has observed, while considering the scope and ambit of Section 311, that the very usage of", "index": 94, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "the word such as, \"any Court\" \"at any stage\", or \"any enquiry or trial or other proceedings\" \"any person\" and \"any such person\" clearly spells out that the Section has expressed in the widest possible terms and do not limit the discretion of the Court in any way. However, as noted above, the very width requires a corresponding caution that the discretionary powers should be invoked as the exigencies of justice require and exercised judicially with circumspection and consistently with the provisions of the Code. The second part of the section does not allow any discretion but obligates and binds the Court to take necessary steps if the fresh evidence to be obtained is essential to the just decision of the case - 'essential', to an active and alert mind and not to one which is bent to abandon or abdicate. Object of the Section is to enable the court to arrive at the truth irrespective of the fact that the prosecution or the defence has failed to produce some evidence which is necessary for a just and proper disposal of the case. The power is exercised and the evidence is examined neither to help the prosecution nor the defence, if the Court feels that there is necessity to act in terms of Section 311 but only to subserve the cause of justice and public interest. It is done with an object of getting the evidence in aid of a just decision and to upheld the truth. 45. It is not that in every case where the witness who had given evidence before Court wants to change his mind and is prepared to speak differently, that the Court concerned should readily accede to such request by lending its assistance. If the witness who deposed one way earlier comes before the", "index": 95, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "appellate Court with a prayer that he is prepared to give evidence which is materially different from what he has given earlier at the trial with the reasons for the earlier lapse, the Court can consider the genuineness of the prayer 140in the context as to whether the party concerned had a fair opportunity to speak the truth earlier and in an appropriate case accept it. It is not that the power is to be exercised in a routine manner, but being an exception to the ordinary rule of disposal of appeal on the basis of records received in exceptional cases or extraordinary situation the Court can neither feel powerless nor abdicate its duty to arrive at the truth and satisfy the ends of justice. The Court can certainly be guided by the metaphor, separate the grain from the chaff, and in a case which has telltale imprint of reasonableness and genuineness in the prayer, the same has to be accepted, at least to consider the worth, credibility and the acceptability of the same on merits of the material sought to be brought in. 46. Ultimately, as noted above, ad nauseam the duty of the Court is to arrive at the truth and subserve the ends of justice. Section 311 of the Code does not confer any party any right to examine, cross-examine and re-examine any witness. This is a power given to the Court not to be merely exercised at the bidding of any one party/person but the powers conferred and discretion vested are to prevent any irretrievable or immeasurable damage to the cause of society, public interest and miscarriage of justice. Recourse may be had by Courts to power under this section only for the purpose of discovering relevant facts or obtaining proper proof of such facts as", "index": 96, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "are necessary to arrive at a justice decision in the case. 47. Section 391 of the Code is another salutary provision which clothes the Courts with the power of effectively decide an appeal. Though Section 386 envisages the normal and ordinary manner and method of disposal of an appeal, yet it does not and cannot be said to exhaustively enumerate the modes by which alone the Court can deal with an appeal. Section 391 is one such exception to the ordinary rule and if the appellate Court considers additional evidence to be necessary, the provisions in Section 386 and Section 391 have to be harmoniously considered to enable the appeal to be considered and disposed of also in the light of the additional evidence as well. For this purpose it is open to the appellate Court to call for further evidence before the appeal is disposed of. The appellate Court can direct the taking up of further evidence in support of the prosecution; a fortiori it is open to the court to direct that the accused persons may also be given a chance of adducing further evidence. Section 391 is in the nature of an exception to the general rule and the powers under it must also be exercised 141with great care, specially on behalf of the prosecution lest the admission of additional evidence for the prosecution operates in a manner prejudicial to the defence of the accused. The primary object of Section 391 is the prevention of guilty man's escape through some careless or ignorant proceedings before a Court or vindication of an innocent person wrongfully accused. Where the court through some carelessness or ignorance has omitted to record the circumstances essential to elucidation of truth, the exercise of powers under Section 391 is desirable. 48. The legislature intent", "index": 97, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "in enacting Section 391 appears to be the empowerment of the appellate court to see that justice is done between the prosecutor and the persons prosecuted and if the appellate Court finds that certain evidence is necessary in order to enable it to give a correct and proper findings, it would be justified in taking action under Section 391. 49. There is no restriction in the wording of Section 391 either as to the nature of the evidence or that it is to be taken for the prosecution only or that the provisions of the Section are only to be invoked when formal proof for the prosecution is necessary. If the appellate Court thinks that it is necessary in the interest of justice to take additional evidence it shall do so. There is nothing in the provision limiting it to cases where there has been merely some formal defect. The matter is one of the discretion of the appellate Court. As re-iterated supra the ends of justice are not satisfied only when the accused in a criminal case is acquitted. The community acting through the State and the public prosecutor is also entitled to justice. The cause of the community deserves equal treatment at the hands of the Court in the discharge of its judicial functions.\u201d 78) The appellants have placed heavy reliance on the position in England to argue that there is a wide duty of disclosure on the public prosecutor. It was argued that any non-disclosure of evidence, whether or not it is relied upon by the prosecution, must be made available to the 142defense. In the absence of this, it was argued, there would be a violation of the right to fair trial. 79) In the light of this argument, let us examine the exact nature of", "index": 98, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "the duty of disclosure on the public prosecutor in ordinary cases of criminal trial.

The suppression of material capable of establishing the innocence of the accused shall be scrupulously avoided.\u201d Therefore, it is clear that the Code & the Bar Council of India Rules provide a wide duty of disclosure. But this 144duty is limited to evidence on which the prosecutor proposes to place reliance during the trial. Mr. Ram Jethmalani argued that this duty extends beyond these provisions, and includes even that evidence which may not have been used by the prosecutor during the trial. As we have already mentioned, for this purpose, he relied upon the position in England. 80) Currently, the", "index": 100, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "position in England is governed by the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act, 1996. Prior to this enactment, the position was squarely covered by common law. This position comes out primarily in two cases. In R. v Ward (Judith Theresa) (1993) 2 All E.R. 577, Court of Appeal held that it was the duty of the prosecution to ensure fair trial for both the prosecution and the accused. The duty of disclosure would usually be performed by supplying the copies of witness statements to the defense and all relevant experiments and tests must also be disclosed. It was held that the common law duty to disclose would cover anything which might assist the 145defense. Non-compliance with this duty would amount to \u201cirregularity in the course of the trial\u201d under Section 2(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1988. 81) In R v. Preston & Ors. (1993) 4 All ER 638, on which the appellants specifically relied upon, dealt with the non- disclosure of a telephonic conversation in a matter dealing with the Interception of Communications Act, 1985. The relevant material had been destroyed in pursuance of Section 6 of the same Act. In appeal, the defendants essentially argued that the non-disclosure of the contents of the call to the defense amounted to a material irregularity. The court held that it is true that the mere fact that the material was not to be used as evidence did not mean that the material was worthless, especially, when it might have been of assistance to the defendant. But at the same time, it was also held that: \u201csince the purpose of a warrant issued under s.2(2)(b) of the 1985 Act did not extend to the amassing of evidence with a view to the prosecution of offenders, and since the investigating authority was under a", "index": 101, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "duty under s.6 of the Act to destroy all material obtained by means of an interception as soon as its retention was no longer necessary for the prevention or detection of serious crime, the destruction of the documents obtained from the interception and their 146consequent unavailability for disclosure could not be relied upon by Defendants as a material irregularity in the course of their trial\u201d. Thus the position under common law is clear, i.e. subject to exceptions like sensitive information and public interest immunity, the prosecution should disclose any material which might be exculpatory to the defence. 82) In the Indian Criminal jurisprudence, the accused is placed in a somewhat advantageous position than under different jurisprudence of some of the countries in the world. The criminal justice administration system in India places human rights and dignity for human life at a much higher pedestal. In our jurisprudence an accused is presumed to be innocent till proved guilty, the alleged accused is entitled to fairness and true investigation and fair trial and the prosecution is expected to play balanced role in the trial of a crime. The investigation should be judicious, fair, transparent and expeditious to ensure compliance to the basic rule of law. These are the fundamental canons of our criminal jurisprudence and they are quite in conformity with the constitutional 147mandate contained in Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India. A person is entitled to be tried according to the law in force at the time of commission of offence. A person could not be punished for the same offence twice and most significantly cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself and he cannot be deprived of his personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. The law in relation to investigation of", "index": 102, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "offences and rights of an accused, in our country, has developed with the passage of time. On the one hand, power is vested in the investigating officer to conduct the investigation freely and transparently. Even the Courts do not normally have the right to interfere in the investigation. It exclusively falls in the domain of the investigating agency. In exceptional cases the High Courts have monitored the investigation but again within a very limited scope. There, on the other a duty is cast upon the prosecutor to ensure that rights of an accused are not infringed and he gets a fair chance to put forward 148his defence so as to ensure that a guilty does not go scot free while an innocent is not punished. Even in the might of the State the rights of an accused cannot be undermined, he must be tried in consonance with the provisions of the constitutional mandate. The cumulative effect of this constitutional philosophy is that both the Courts and the investigating agency should operate in their own independent fields while ensuring adherence to basic rule of law. It is not only the responsibility of the investigating agency but as well that of the Courts to ensure that investigation is fair and does not in any way hamper the freedom of an individual except in accordance with law. Equally enforceable canon of criminal law is that the high responsibility lies upon the investigating agency not to conduct an investigation in tainted and unfair manner. The investigation should not prima facie be indicative of bias mind and every effort should be made to bring the guilty to law as nobody stands above law de hors his position and influence in the society. In the case 149of Kashmeri Dev v. Delhi Administration and Anrs. [JT 1988", "index": 103, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "(2) SC 293] it has been held that the record of investigation should not show that efforts are being made to protect and shield the guilty even where they are police officers and are alleged to have committed a barbaric offence/crime. The Courts have even declined to accept the report submitted by the investigating officer where it is glaringly unfair and offends basic canons of criminal investigation and jurisprudence. Contra veritatem lex nunquam aliquid permittit: implies a duty on the Court to accept and accord its approval only to a report which is result of faithful and fruitful investigation. The Court is not to accept the report which is contra legem but to conduct judicious and fair investigation and submit a report in accordance with Section 173 of the Code which places a burden and obligation on the State Administration. The aim of criminal justice is two-fold. Severely punishing and really or sufficiently preventing the crime. Both these objects can be achieved only by fair 150investigation into the commission of crime, sincerely proving the case of the prosecution before the Court and the guilty is punished in accordance with law. 83) Historically but consistently the view of this Court has been that an investigation must be fair and effective, must proceed in proper direction in consonance with the ingredients of the offence and not in haphazard manner. In some cases besides investigation being effective the accused may have to prove miscarriage of justice but once it is shown the accused would be entitled to definite benefit in accordance with law. The investigation should be conducted in a manner so as to draw a just balance between citizen\u2019s right under Articles 19 and 21 and expensive power of the police to make investigation.

In 151Nirmal Singh Kahlon vs. State of Punjab [AIR 2009 SC 984] this Court specifically stated that a concept of fair investigation and fair trial are concomitant to preservation of fundamental right of accused under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. We have referred to this concept of judicious and fair investigation as the right of the accused to fair defence emerges from this concept itself. The accused is not subjected to harassment, his right to defence is not unduly hampered and what he is entitled to received in accordance with law is not denied to him contrary to law. 84) It is pertinent to note here that one of the established canons of just, fair and transparent investigation is the right of defence of an accused. An accused may be entitled to ask for certain documents during the course of enquiry/trial by the Court. Let us examine the extent of this right of an accused in light of the statutory provisions and the manner in which the law has developed under the criminal jurisprudence. To understand this concept in its 152right perspective we must notice the scheme under the provisions of Section 170 to 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code. All these provisions fall under Chapter XII of the Code which deals with, information of the police and their powers to investigate. The power of the police to investigate freely and fairly is well recognized and codified in law.

State of Hyderabad, A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 51, this Court stated the principle of law that the criminal court may send for the police diaries of a case under inquiry/trial in such court and may use such diaries, not as evidence in the case but to aid in such inquiry or trial. It seems to the Court that the learned 156Judge in error in making use of the police diaries at all in his judgment and in seeking confirmation of his opinion on the question of appreciation of evidence from statements contained in those diaries. The proper use of diaries he could make in terms of Section 172 Cr.P.C. by elucidating points which need clarification. The Court in this case was primarily concerned with the argument that diaries were not produced. 87) Further in the case of Khatri v. State of Bihar A.I.R. 1981 SC 1068 though in a writ petition this Court was concerned with a question whether the documents called for by the Court vide its Order dated 16th February, 1981 liable to be produced by the State or production of those documents is barred under Sections 162 & 172 of the Code and the petitioners in those cases are not entitled to see such documents.

If that be so, it is difficult to see how the State can resist the production of these reports and their use as evidence of these reports and their use as evidence in the present proceeding. These reports are clearly relevant under Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act.\u201d 88) In the case of Malkiat Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab (1991) 4 SCC 341 this Court reiterated the principle that use of entries in the case diary is really of no use and is of benefit to the accused but unless the investigating officer or the Court uses the entries in the case where either to refresh the memory or contradicting the investigating officer as previous statement under Section 161 in terms of Section 145 of the Evidence Act the entries can be used by the accused as evidence. The free use thereof is not permissible under defence. 89) In case Mukund Lal v. Union of India A.I.R. 1989 SC 144, this Court clearly stated the denial to the accused of an unfettered right to make roving inspection of the entries in the case diary regardless of whether these entries are used by the police officer concerned to refresh his memory or regardless of the fact whether the Court has used these entries for the 158purpose of contradicting such police officer cannot be said to be unreasonable.

A.I.R. 1995 SC 1748 wherein this Court while issuing direction for requiring the State to make a general hearing in terms of Section 172 of the Code clearly stated that it was mandatory for the police officer/in charge to maintain the diary in terms of the said provision and there is jurisdiction in the criminal code to call such diaries and make use of them not as evidence but only to aid such inquiry or trial. It is generally confined to utilize the information therein as foundation for the question put to the witnesses, particularly, to the police witnesses where the police officer has used the entries to refresh his memory or if the Court uses them for the 159purpose of contradicting such police officer then provisions of Section 161, or 145, would be applicable. The right of the accused to cross-examine the police officer with reference to the entries in the General Diary is very much limited in extent and even that limited scope arises only when the Court uses the entries for the aforestated purposes. The investigating officer has a right to refresh his memories and can refer to the general diary. The Court has power to summon the case diary in exercise of its powers and for the purposes stated.

Fairness in both these actions essentially needs to be adhered to. Under Section 170, the documents during investigation are required to be forwarded to the Magistrate, while in terms of Section 173 (5) all documents or relevant extracts and the statement recorded under Section 161 have to be forwarded to the Magistrate. The investigating officer is entitled to collect all the material, what in his wisdom is required for proving the guilt of the offender. He can record statement in terms of Section 161 and his power to investigate the matter is a very wide one, which is regulated by the provisions of the Code. The statement recorded under Section 161 is not evidence per se under Section 162 of the Code. The right of the accused to receive the documents/statements submitted before the Court is absolute and it must be adhered to by the prosecution and the Court must ensure supply of documents/statements to the accused in accordance with law.

The question put by the Public Prosecutor, was at best clarificatory, and by no stretch of imagination can be termed as a leading question favouring/eliciting an answer favouring the prosecution.

The said judgment is clearly distinguishable. On the facts in that case, this Court found that the prosecutor had put leading questions, without objections by the defence, to several material and key witnesses regarding the culpability of the accused. The extent of the leading questions put, were on the facts of that case found to violate the constitutional right of a fair trial of the 171accused. The facts of the present appeal are wholly different. The petitioner had adequate and competent legal representation before the trial Court and leading questions, if any, put by the prosecutor were objected to by the defence and several questions were disallowed by the trial court. Furthermore, the finding of guilt of the appellant herein by the High Court has not been on account of any of the answers elicited to any such questions. It is not as if every single leading question would invalidate the trial. The impact of the leading questions, if any, has to be assessed on the facts of each case. Efforts made to trace Sanjay Mehtani: 98) It has been contended by the learned senior counsel for the appellant/Manu Sharma that the Sanjay Mehtani, friend of Malani Ramani, who was also present at Qutub Colonnade at the scene of offence was deliberately not examined by the Prosecution.

Further, it was pointed out that bare perusal of the trial Court record of the present case will clearly bring out the fallacy in the said argument of the defence. The Police while filing the charge-sheet before the Magistrate had enlisted Sanjay Mehtani\u2019s name in the list of witnesses. This fact clearly shows that the prosecution had the intention to examine Sanjay Mehtani as their witness. Further, the said witness was summoned by the Court for examination vide orders dated 28.11.2001, 08.02.2002, 27.11.2003 and 11.12.2003. The said sequence of events clearly show that the prosecution not only wanted to examine him as a witness, but tried serving him with the summons many times, but the same could not be achieved as Sanjay Mehtani had by 173then shifted to Hong Kong and was not staying in India. Therefore to contend that Sanjay Mehtani was deliberately not examined by the Prosecution is absolutely baseless and not founded on the basis of the record.

The above evidence of the witnesses clearly establishes beyond reasonable doubt that accused Manu Sharma absconded after committing the crime and surrendered on 06.05.1999 after extensive searches were made. 100) A criminal trial is not an enquiry into the conduct of an accused for any purpose other than to determine whether he is guilty of the offence charged. In this connection, that piece of conduct can be held to be incriminatory which has no reasonable explanation except on the hypothesis that he is guilty. Conduct which destroys the presumption of innocence can alone be 175considered as material. In this regard, it is useful to refer Anant Chaintaman Lagu vs. State of Bombay AIR 1960 SC 500:- \u201cCircumstantial evidence in this context means a comBeenation of facts creating a network through which there is no escape for the accused, because the facts taken as a whole do not admit of any inference but of his guilt\u2026. this conduct of the accused was so knit together as to make a network of circumstances pointing only to his guilt\u2026\u2026his methods was his own undoing; because even the long arm of coincidence could not explain the multitude of circumstances against him, and they destroyed the presumption of innocence with which law clothed him.\u201d Thus, it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt that accused Manu Sharma absconded after the incident which is a very relevant conduct u/s 8 of Evidence Act.

The photocopy of the said statement is Ex PW2/C which is in my hand and bears my signatures at point A. I correctly recorded statement of Shyan Munshi and did not add or omit therefrom on my own.

As far as refusal of TIP by accused Manu Sharma is concerned, there is no justification in the stand of the defence that TIP was not held due to his photo or he himself being shown to the witness. In this regard, it would be relevant to note that accused Manu Sharma surrendered on 06.05.99 and on 07.05.99 he was produced in muffled face before the MM Shri Rajneesh Gupta PW-79 and the proceedings thereof are recorded vide Ex PW-79/G wherein accused Manu 184Sharma\u2019s contention for refusal of TIP is that his photograph has appeared in newspapers and his photograph has been shown to the witnesses and that he has been shown physically to the witnesses.

No. PW 101/15 photograph dated 06.05.1999 clearly shows that he is in muffled face. In the absence of any defence refusal of TIP on this ground is totally unjustified and an adverse inference ought to be drawn in this regard. 111) The next contention of the defence for refusal of TIP is that his photograph has been shown to the witnesses is also incorrect. It is not disputed that the photograph of accused Manu Sharma was obtained from his farmhouse 185located in Samalkha", "index": 126, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "on the intervening night 30.04.1999 & 01.05.1999. However, it is further in evidence of PW-87 that he went to Chandigarh and he took the photograph of accused Manu Sharma for the purposes of identification and it was with him till 06.05.1999. Thus the photo of accused Manu Sharma could not have been shown to any of the witnesses because the witnesses were either in Delhi or Kolkata not in Chandigarh. The only witness who has deposed with regard to the photograph having been shown is PW-6 wherein she has stated: \u201cIt could be that the photograph of Manu Sharma that had been shown to me on 01.05.1999 but since I was not in good frame of mind and rather disturbed for the whole week and therefore I do not remember whether the photograph of Manu Sharma was shown to me on 01.05.1999.\u201d Her testimony on this point is clearly wavering in view of the fact that immediately after the incident she fainted and that is why her statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded only on 03.05.99. Moreover, it was explained that since on 02.05.99 the photograph in question was not available in Delhi itself and therefore there was no chance of showing the photograph to this 186witness, as on 01.05.99 she was unwell and her statement also could not be recorded and thus the issue of showing her the photograph could not arise. Further, this witness nowhere says that photographs were shown to her parents as well as being sought to be inferred by the defence. Thus refusal of TIP on this ground was unjustified by accused Manu Sharma in the morning of 07.05.1999. It is further submitted that after the refusal of TIP it is only thereafter that the accused Manu Sharma was shown to the witnesses PW-6,", "index": 127, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "PW-20 and PW-24 and their statements under Section 161 Cr.P.C. were recorded with regard to the identification of accused Manu Sharma. The said process of identification was necessary for the IO to be certain that this is the man that the said witnesses had witnessed/seen as the person responsible. In the light of Manu Sharma\u2019s refusal, the police had little choice but to formally show the photo to the witnesses and record their statement in that regard. Thus, firstly his refusal is not justified on the ground that he has been shown to the 187witnesses, moreover, he was shown to the witness only after his refusal of TIP so that it is verified that he is the same person who is involved in the incident and no adverse inference on this count can be taken against the prosecution. 112) It is further pointed out that the accused Manu Sharma was sent to judicial custody on 15.05.1999 and the statement of witnesses continued even thereafter and thus resort to photo identification was properly taken by mixing the photograph of accused Manu Sharma with number of other photographs and asking the witnesses to pick up the photograph of the person they had witnessed on the fateful night and the morning thereafter i.e. 29/30.04.99. This mode of photo identification was resorted to vis-\u00e0-vis Deepak Bhojwani PW-1 on 24.05.1999 at Delhi, Shiv Dass PW-3 and Karan Rajput PW-4 on 29.05.99 and Shyan Munshi PW-2 on 19.05.99 at Calcutta. Thus there is no merit in the contention of 188the defense that the dock identification was a farce as it was done for the first time in the Court. 113) It is also contended by the defence that since the photographs were shown to the witnesses this circumstance renders the whole evidence of identification in Court", "index": 128, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "as inadmissible. For this, it was pointed out that photo identification or TIP before the Magistrate, are all aides in investigation and do not form substantive evidence. Substantive evidence is the evidence of the witness in the court on oath, which can never be rendered inadmissible on this count. It is further pointed out that photo identification is not hit by 162 Cr.P.C. as adverted to by the defense as the photographs have not been signed by the witnesses. In support of his argument the senior counsel for Manu Sharma relies on the judgment of Kartar Singh vs. Union of India (1994) 3 SCC 569 at page 711 wherein while dealing with Section 22 TADA the Court observed that photo TIP is bad in law. It is useful to mention that the said judgment has been distinguished in 189Umar Abdul Sakoor Sorathia vs. Intelligence Officer, Narcotic Control Bureau, (2000) 1 SCC 138 at page 143 where a Photo Identification has been held to be valid. The relevant extract of the said judgment is as follows:- \u201c10. The next circumstance highlighted by the learned counsel for the respondent is that a photo of the appellant was shown to Mr. Albert Mkhatshwa later and he identified that figure in the photo as the person whom he saw driving the car at the time of interception of the truck. 11. It was contended that identification by photo is inadmissible in evidence and, therefore, the same cannot be used. No legal provision has been brought to our notice, which inhibits the admissibility of such evidence. However, learned counsel invited our attention to the observations of the Constitution Bench in Kartar Singh vs. State of Punjab which struck down Section 22 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987. By that provision the evidence", "index": 129, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "of a witness regarding identification of a proclaimed offender in a terrorist case on the basis of the photograph was given the same value as the evidence of a test identification parade. This Court observed in that context: (SCC p. 711, para 361) 361. If the evidence regarding the identification on the basis of a photograph is to be held to have the same value as the evidence of a test identification parade, we feel that gross injustice to the detriment of the persons suspected may result. Therefore, we are inclined to strike down this provision and accordingly we strike down Section 22 of the Act. 12. In the present case prosecution does not say that they would rest with the identification made by Mr. Mkhatshwa when the photograph was shown to him. Prosecution has to examine him as a witness in the court and he has to identify the accused in the court. Then alone it would become substantive evidence. But that does not mean that at this stage the court is disabled from considering the prospect of such a witness correctly identifying the appellant during trial. In so considering the court can take into account the fact that during investigation the photograph of the appellant was shown to the witness and he identified that 190person as the one whom he saw at the relevant time. It must be borne in mind that the appellant is not a proclaimed offender and we are not considering the eventuality in which he would be so proclaimed. So the observations made in Kartar Singh in a different context is of no avail to the appellant.\u201d Even a TIP before a Magistrate is otherwise hit by Section 162 of the Code. Therefore to say that a photo identification is hit by section 162", "index": 130, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "is wrong. It is not a substantive piece of evidence. It is only by virtue of section 9 of the Evidence Act that the same i.e. the act of identification becomes admissible in Court. The logic behind TIP, which will include photo identification lies in the fact that it is only an aid to investigation, where an accused is not known to the witnesses, the IO conducts a TIP to ensure that he has got the right person as an accused. The practice is not born out of procedure, but out of prudence. At best it can be brought under Section 8 of the Evidence Act, as evidence of conduct of a witness in photo identifying the accused in the presence of an IO or the Magistrate, during the course of an investigation. 191114) Mr. Jethmalani has further argued on the proposition that mere dock identification is no identification in the eyes of law unless corroborated by previous TIP before the Magistrate. It has been further argued that in any case, even identification in Court is not enough and that there should be something more to hold the accused liable. In support of its arguments, he placed heavy reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of Hari Nath & Ors vs. State of U.P. (1988) 1 SCC 14 and Budhsen & Others vs. State of U.P. (1970) 2 SCC 128. A close scrutiny of these judgments will reveal that they infact support the case of the Prosecution. These judgments make it abundantly clear that even where there is no previous TIP, the Court may appreciate the dock identification as being above-board and more than conclusive. 115) The law as it stands today is set out in the following decisions of this Court which are reproduced as 192hereinunder", "index": 131, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "in Munshi Singh Gautam vs. State of M.P. (2005) 9 SCC 631, at page 643: \u201c16. As was observed by this Court in Matru vs. State of U.P. 1971 2 SCC 75 identification tests do not constitute substantive evidence. They are primarily meant for the purpose of helping the investigating agency with an assurance that their progress with the investigation into the offence is proceeding on the right lines. The identification can only be used as corroborative of the statement in Court. (See Santokh Singh vs. Izhar Hussain 1973 2 SCC 406.) The necessity for holding an identification parade can arise only when the accused are not previously known to the witnesses. The whole idea of a test identification parade is that witnesses who claim to have seen the culprits at the time of occurrence are to identify them from the midst of other persons without any aid or any other source. The test is done to check upon their veracity. In other words, the main object of holding an identification parade, during the investigation stage, is to test the memory of the witnesses based upon first impression and also to enable the prosecution to decide whether all or any of them could be cited as eyewitnesses of the crime. The identification proceedings are in the nature of tests and significantly, therefore, there is no provision for it in the Code and the Evidence Act. It is desirable that a test identification parade should be conducted as soon as after the arrest of the accused. This becomes necessary to eliminate the possibility of the accused being shown to the witnesses prior to the test identification parade. This is a very common plea of the accused and, therefore, the prosecution has to be cautious to ensure that there is no scope", "index": 132, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "for making such an allegation.

This rule of prudence, however, is subject to exception, when, for example, the court is impressed by a particular witness on whose testimony it can safely rely, without such or other corroboration. The identification parades belong to the stage of investigation, and there is no provision in the Code which obliges the investigation agency to hold or confers a right upon the accused to claim a test identification parade.

As observed by this Court in Jadunath Singh vs. State of U.P. 17 absence of test identification is not necessarioy fatal.

In appropriate cases it may accept the evidence of identification even without insisting on corroboration.\u201d 195116) Mr. Ram Jethmalani has further placed heavy reliance on two Books by foreign authors, namely, \u2018\u2019Proof of Guilt by Glanville Williams,\u2019 3rd Edition and \u2018Eye Witness Identification in Criminal Cases\u2019 by Patrick M.

These texts only reiterate what the various courts have held time and again. The view of the said author has been quoted by this Court, the earliest judgment being Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade vs. State of Maharashtra, (1973) 2 SCC 793, at page 800: \u201cThe evil of acquitting a guilty person light heartedly as a learned Author (Glanville Williams in \u2018Proof of Guilt\u2019) has sapiently observed, goes much beyond the simple fact that just one guilty person has gone unpunished. If unmerited acquittals become general, they tend to lead to a cynical disregard of the law, and this in turn leads to a public demand for harsher legal presumptions against indicted persons and more severe punishment of those who are found guilty. Thus, too frequent acquittals of the guilty may lead to a ferocious penal law, eventually eroding the judicial protection of the guiltless. For all these reasons it is true to say, with Viscount Simon, that a miscarriage of justice may arise from the acquittal of the guilty no less", "index": 136, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "than from the conviction of the innocent.\u201d 117) Learned Solicitor General submitted that, even otherwise, an adverse inference ought to be drawn against 196the appellants for their refusal to join the TIP. This view has found favor time and again by this Court. It is pertinent to note that it is dock identification which is a substantive piece of evidence. Therefore even where no TIP is conducted no prejudice can be caused to the case of the Prosecution. In Mullagiri Vajram vs. State of A.P. 1993 Supp. (2) SCC 198, it was held that though the accused was seen by the witness in custody, any infirmity in TIP will not affect the outcome of the case, since the deposition of the witnesses in Court was reliable and could sustain a conviction. The photo identification and TIP are only aides in the investigation and does not form substantive evidence. The substantive evidence is the evidence in the court in oath. 118) The following decisions relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the appellant are clearly distinguishable from the present facts and thus are not applicable. N.J. Suraj vs. State (2004) 11 SCC 346 is distinguishable as there was no direct evidence on record against the 197accused and the prosecution\u2019s case was based on last seen evidence of accused with deceased and circumstantial evidence. The admission of witnesses in regard to showing of photographs prior to TIP was coupled with the fact that the writing of the accused did not match with the entries made in the entry register which was contrary to the case of the prosecution. 119) Laxmipat Chararia vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1968 SC 938, is distinguishable as the witness whose statement was subjected to arguments as being put under pressure of prosecution and was shown photographs", "index": 137, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "of the accused was infact an accomplice and her statement was also relied upon by the Court and held that her evidence is admissible. 120) Hari Nath & Anr vs. State of U.P.

Secondly, as it was also held that even on the premise that no prior acquaintance was there, the TIP lacked promptitude as was conducted after an unexplained delay of more than 4 months. 121) The judgment in Kanan & Ors vs. State of Kerala (1979) 3 SCC 319, is distinguishable as the witness though admitted that he knew the two accused by face and yet he had named them while identifying them in Court, which raised element of doubt & that names of the accused were supplied to him from outside. 122) Dana Yadav vs. State of Bihar (2002) 7 SCC 295 is also distinguishable as the identification by the witness in court was not relied upon as the witness did not name the accused before the Police but in Court had identified and also named the accused, and as the identification was 199not further corroborated by either previous identification or any other evidence. While other witnesses though named the accused before the police but failed to identify him in court. 123) In Vijayan vs. State of Kerala (1999) 3 SCC 54, the witness was admittedly shown the photograph", "index": 138, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "of the accused before the TIP and further told to identify the tallest man in the parade, as such this TIP was discarded and in this light the dock identification of the witness was also discarded.

(1998) 4 SCC 605 is not applicable on the facts of the present case in so far as the issue of photo identification is concerned. The aforesaid judgment which is sought to be relied upon by the appellant in support to their contention on the issue that absence of TIP makes the dock identification weak evidence is not applicable on the facts of the present 200case. In the said decision the prosecution failed to hold TIP whereas in case at hand the accused person refused TIP. The newspaper reports duly exhibited by PW 101 in the present case nowhere show photographs of the accused persons. 125) Learned senior counsel for the appellant has argued that the statement of the accused recorded under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code may be treated as evidence and by doing so this Court must take into consideration the stand taken by the appellant as regards his gun having been taken away by the police. In support of his argument, he relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Hate Singh Bhagar Singh vs. State of Madhya Bharat, AIR 1953 SC 468. It has been further argued that the evidence of witnesses has not been put to the appellant thereby causing prejudice to the appellant. The said proposition of law is misplaced since a specific provision has been provided by way of", "index": 139, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "Section 315 of the Code whereby an accused can, as a matter of right, 201appear as a witness on his own behalf.

Thus it cannot be urged by the defence merely in order to suit his convenience that his statement may be treated as evidence and that all facts stated therein be treated as true unless contradicted by the prosecution. While answer given by the accused to question put under Section 313 of the Code are not per se evidence because, firstly, it is not on oath and, secondly, the other party i.e., the prosecution does not get an opportunity to cross-examine the accused, it is nevertheless subject to consideration by the Court to the limited extent of drawing an adverse inference against such accused for any false answers voluntarily offered by him and to provide an additional/missing link in the chain of circumstances. The judgment relied upon is of no use to the defence since the same pertains to a period where the law did not allow the accused to step into the 202witness box as a witness of his own innocence. 126) Regarding the contention that evidence of each witness must be put to the accused, it must be clarified that only the circumstances need to be put and not the entire testimony. It is apt to quote the following decision of this Court i.e., State of Punjab vs. Swaran Singh, (2005) 6 SCC 101 at page 104: \u201c9. The only reason given by the learned Single Judge of the High Court for acquitting the accused is that the evidence of PW 1 and PW 4 was not specifically put", "index": 140, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "to the accused under Section 313 CrPC and it was held that in the absence of these facts in the form of questions to the accused, the evidence could not have been used against him. It is also pertinent to note in this regard that when PW 1 and PW 4 were examined as witnesses, the accused did not seriously dispute the evidence of PW 1 or PW 4. The only cross-examination was that it was incorrect to suggest that the case property was not deposited with him and he had deposed falsely. So also, the evidence of PW 4 was not challenged in the cross-examination except for a general suggestion that he had been deposing falsely and that no case property was handed over to him by PW 1 Harbhajan Singh. The accused had no case that the seal was ever tampered with by any person and that there was any case of mistaken identity as regards the sample and that the report of the chemical analyst was not of the same sample taken from the accused. Except making a general suggestion, the accused had completely admitted the evidence of PW 1 and PW 4 as regards the receipt of the sample, sealing of the same and sending it to the chemical analyst. This was pointed out only to show that the accused was not in any way prejudiced by the fact of not having been questioned by making a specific reference to the 203evidence of PW 1 and PW 4. As regards the questioning of the accused under Section 313 CrPC, the relevant provision is as follows: \u201c313. Power to examine the accused.\u2014(1) In every inquiry or trial, for the purpose of enabling the accused personally to explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him, the court\u2014", "index": 141, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "(a) may at any stage, without previously warning the accused, put such questions to him as the court considers necessary; (b) shall, after the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before he is called on for his defence, question him generally on the case: Provided that in a summons case, where the court has dispensed with the personal attendance of the accused, it may also dispense with his examination under clause (b). (2) No oath shall be administered to the accused when he is examined under sub-section (1). (3) The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer such questions, or by giving false answers to them. (4) The answers given by the accused may be taken into consideration in such inquiry or trial, and put in evidence for or against him in any other inquiry into, or trial for, any other offence which such answers may tend to show he has committed.\u201d 10.

It may be noticed that the entire evidence is recorded in his presence and he is given full opportunity to cross- examine each and every witness examined on the prosecution side. He is given copies of all documents which are sought to be relied on by the prosecution. Apart from all these, as part of fair trial the accused is given opportunity to give his explanation regarding the evidence adduced by the prosecution. However, it is not necessary that the entire prosecution evidence need be put to him and answers elicited from the accused.

There shall not be failure of justice on account of an unfair trial. 15. In the instant case, the accused was not in any way prejudiced by not giving him an opportunity to answer specifically regarding the evidence of PW 1 and PW 4. If at all, the evidence of PW 1 and PW 4 was recorded in his presence, he had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses but he did not specifically cross-examine these two witnesses in respect of the facts deposed by them. The learned Single Judge seriously erred in holding that the evidence of PW 1 and PW 4 could not have been used against the accused. The acquittal of the accused was improper as the evidence in this case clearly established that the accused was in possession of 5 kg of opium and thereby committed the offence under Section 18 of the NDPS Act.\u201d 127) Further it is not necessary that the entire prosecution evidence need to be put to the accused and answers elicited from him/even if an omission to bring to the attention of the accused an inculpatory material has occurred that ipso facto does not vitiate the proceedings, the accused has to show failure of justice as held in Swaran Singh (supra) and followed in Harender Nath 205Chakraborty vs. State of West Bengal, (2009)", "index": 143, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "2 SCC 758. 128) Hate Singh\u2019s case (supra) relied upon by the appellant is clearly distinguishable from the facts of the present case. In the said matter, the case of the prosecution was that two brothers Hate and Bheru fired one shot each at the deceased who received three wounds. It was opined that three wounds which could have been from a single shot. It was the consistent stand of the Bheru that he fired the shots (with double barrel), whose appeal was, therefore, dismissed in limine. While that of Hate (appellant in the said case) was that though present with a gun, he did not fire any shot (with his single barrel). That single barrel was found loaded (Article E) this fact was accepted throughout. Witnesses also saw Bheru firing the first shot. The Court held that the fact that both the brothers absconded was given much importance by the High Court and Sessions Court but were not asked to explain it at any stage. 206129) Ranvir Yadav vs. State of Bihar, (2009) 6 SCC 595 relied upon by the appellant is also distinguishable on facts as there was no accusation specifically put in the question during examination to the accused.

This Court has time and again held that where an accused furnishes false answers as regards proved facts, the Court ought to draw an adverse inference qua him and such an inference shall become an additional circumstance to prove the guilt of the accused. In this regard, the prosecution seeks to place reliance on the judgments of this Court in Peresadi vs. State of U.P., (1957) Crl.L.J. 328, State of M.P. vs. Ratan Lal, AIR 1994 SC 458 and Anthony D\u2019Souza vs. State of Karnataka", "index": 144, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "(2003) 1 SCC 259 where this Court has drawn an adverse inference for wrong answers given by the appellant under Section 313 Cr.P.C.

It was his duty to have kept the same in safe custody and to explain its whereabouts. It is proved beyond reasonable doubt on record that extensive efforts were made to trace the pistol and the same could not be recovered. Moreover as per the testimony of CN Kumar, PW-43, DSP/NCRB, RK Puram there is no complaint or report of the said pistol. Thus an adverse inference has to be drawn against the accused-Manu Sharma for non- explanation of the whereabouts of the said pistol. Similarly another plea not supported by any positive evidence led by the appellant-Manu Sharma is that his pistol i.e. the weapon of offence and the arms licence was recovered from his farm house on 30.04.1999, when in 208fact it is an established fact that the pistol could not be recovered and that the licence was surrendered on 06.05.1999 at the time of his arrest. It defies all logic and ordinary course of conduct to allege that the prosecution has withheld the pistol after seizing the same from his farmhouse.

(iii) Adverse inference since no report of theft or loss of Tata safari CH-01-W-6535 It is the defence of the accused-Manu Sharma that the Tata Safari was taken away on 30.04.1999 from Karnal. No report or complaint of the taking away of the vehicle or the theft of the vehicle was ever lodged by the appellant/accused and hence an adverse inference has to be drawn against the accused on this count as well. Further the conduct of the appellant/accused in not taking any steps despite opportunity in reporting the 209alleged taking away of Tata Safari on 30.04.1999 and his licensed pistol on 01.05.1999 in itself is enough material to draw serious adverse inference against the accused. (iv) Appearance of PW-2 Shyan Munshi accompanied by Shri Ashok Bansal, Advocate By order dated 06.03.2000, Shri Ashok Bansal, advocate had appeared as proxy counsel for accused- Manu Sharma before the trial Court and on the same day also took copy of the report of FSL/Jaipur on behalf of accused-Manu Sharma. On 03.05.2001, PW-2, Shyan Munshi, was duly accompanied by Shri Ashok Bansal, advocate wherein he clearly says that he has come with a lawyer for his personal security. On behalf of the State, it was contended that an adverse inference against accused- Manu Sharma has to be drawn for influencing the witness. It may not be out of place to mention here that PW-2, Shyan Munshi, who is the maker of the FIR and complainant of the case, did not fully support the prosecution case though he admitted having made 210statement to the police and having signed the same. The stand of the State cannot be ignored, on the other hand, it is acceptable. 131) Further as per the disclosure of accused-Manu Sharma, the pistol was given to accused", "index": 146, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "- Ravinder Sudan @ Titu (PO).

Accused-Manu Sharma surrendered on 06.05.1999 only after accused Ravinder Sudan @ Titu left the country.

This conduct of accused-Manu Sharma which is relevant and admissible under Section 8 of the Indian Evidence Act an adverse inference has to be drawn against Manu Sharma for this conduct. 211Appeals of other accused: 132) We have already discussed the specific evidence, especially of presence at the time of incident, removal of Tata Safari, call details etc. as well as the evidence of PWs 30 and 101, for conviction under Section 201 read with Section 120-B IPC against the other two appellants, namely, Amardeep Singh Gill @ Tony Gill and Vikas Yadav. We are satisfied that the High Court, on appreciation of the relevant materials, found against them and convicted accordingly. On analysis of all the materials, we agree with their conviction and sentence. Adverse remarks against prosecution and Trial Judge 133) The higher Courts in exercise of their appellate or original jurisdiction may find patent errors of law or fact or appreciation of evidence in the judgment which has been challenged before them. Despite this, what is of significance is that, the Courts should correct the error in judgment and not normally comment upon the judge.

Judicial discipline requires that errors of judgments should be corrected by reasons of law and practice of passing comments against the lower courts needs to be deprecated in no uncertain terms. The individuals come and go but what actually stands forever is the institution. 134) In the present case the High Court in its judgment, on the one hand, explicitly referred to certain criticism/comments/remarks made by the trial Judge against the investigating agency, and observed that they were uncalled for and that they should have been avoided. But, on the other hand, the Division Bench itself while criticizing the reasoning in the judgment under appeal made certain sweeping remarks against the trial Judge. 135) In this regard we are intentionally not referring to the criticism of appreciation of evidence in fact and on law, but are restricting ourselves to certain observations and comments which, in our humble opinion, are criticism of the Judge per 213se and could have been avoided easily by the Division Bench of the High Court. It is also desirable, that the language which may imply an allegation of suspicion in the performance of function of the Court should be carefully examined and unless it is absolutely established on record, comments should be avoided. It will be appropriate to refer to the relevant parts of the judgment in this regard: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.We also find the criticism against him to be a matter of meaningless hair splitting. There is a ring of truth around the deposition of PW 30 whom we find a reliable witness.

The very fact that the empties were sent for examination at such a belated stage, cannot rule out the possibility of foul play to destroy the Prosecution\u2019s case during trial. We, therefore, do not think it necessary to go into further analysis of the evidence of Prem Sagar Manocha.\u201d 214136) Let us examine various judgments of this Court which have persistently taken the view and discouraged observations or disparaging remarks by the higher Courts against the other Courts. In the case of A.M. Mathur vs. Pramod Kumar Gupta & Ors. (1990) 2 SCC 533 the Court stated the dictum that judicial restraint and discipline are as necessary to the orderly administration of justice as they are to the effectiveness of the army. The duty of restraint , this humility of function should be constant theme of our judges. The quality in decision making is as much necessary for judges to command respect as to protect the independence of the judiciary. Judicial restraint in this regard might better be called judicial respect,", "index": 149, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "that is respect by the judiciary. The avoidance of even the appearance of bitterness, so important in a judge, required him not to cast aspersions on the professional conduct of the appellant and that too without an opportunity for him to meet such situation. The Court set 215aside the disparaging remarks that had been made by the High Court against the Advocate General. 137) In the case of a judicial officer approaching this Court for expunction of disparaging remarks on his conduct made by the High Court in the matter of \u2018K\u2019 A Judicial Officer (2001) 3 SCC 54, this Court cautioned the higher courts to use the power of superintendence with great care and circumference before making remarks on unworthy conduct of an officer, his criticism or adverse remarks in relation to judicial pronouncement should be avoided. The Court held as under: \u201cA Subordinate Judge faced with disparaging and undeserving remarks made by a court of superior jurisdiction is not without any remedy. He may approach the High Court invoking its inherent jurisdiction seeking expunction of objectionable remarks which jurisdiction vests in the High Court by virtue of its being a court of record and possessing inherent powers as also the power of superintendence. The view is settled by the law laid down in Raghubir Saran (Dr) vs. State of Bihar (1964) 2 SCR 336. However, if a similar relief is sought for against remarks or observations contained in judgment or order of the High Court the aggrieved judicial officer can, in exceptional cases, approach this Court also invoking its jurisdiction under Articles 136 and/or 142 of the Constitution. \u201d 138) In the case of Zahira Habibulla H. Sheikh & Anr. vs. State of Gujarat & Ors. (2004) 4 SCC 158 another Bench of this Court in unambiguous terms", "index": 150, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "expressed its 216concern about entertaining undesirable submissions against the working of an institution and adverse observations being made in the paragraphs of the judgment. The Court noticed that High Court had made observations and remarks about persons/constitutional bodies like NHRC who were not before it. Proceedings of the Court normally reflect the true state of affairs. Even if it is accepted, that any such submission was made, it was not proper or necessary for the High Court to refer to them in the judgment to finally state that no serious note was taken of the submissions. Avoidance of such manoeuvres would have augured well with the judicial discipline. The expunction and deletion of the contents of paragraph three of the judgment except the last limb therein is ordered and it shall be always read to have not formed part of the judgment. 139) Similarly, a three Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Samya Sett vs. Shambhu Sarkar & Anr.

The High Court had observed that, ignoring of directions should imply an arrogant attitude of the learned 217Judge and was in breach of the canons of judicial discipline and damage the judicial system. This Court has, in several cases, deprecated the practice on the part of judges in passing strictures and in making unsavoury, undeserving, disparaging or derogatory remarks against parties, witnesses as also subordinate officers. 140) It is also worthwhile to refer to the latest judgment of this Court in the case of Parkash Singh Teji vs. Northern India Goods Transport Company Private Limited and Another, (2009) 12 SCC 577.

It has to be noted that the lower judicial officers mostly work under a charged atmosphere and are constantly under psychological pressure.

In those circumstances, remarks/observations and strictures are to be avoided particularly if the officer has no occasion to put forth his reasonings.\u201d 141) In Alok Kumar Roy vs. Dr. S.N.

After reopening of the Court, the matter was placed before the Division Bench presided over by the Chief Justice in accordance with the High Court Rules. The learned Chief Justice made certain remarks as to \u201cunholy haste and hurry\u201d exhibited by the learned vacation Judge in dealing with the case. When the matter reached this Court Wanchoo C.J., observed: (SCR pp 819 F- 820A) \u201cIt is a matter of regret that the learned Chief Justice thought fit to make these remarks in his judgment against a colleague and assumed without any justification or basis that his colleague had acted improperly. Such observations even about Judges of subordinate courts with the clearest evidence of impropriety are uncalled for in a judgment. When made against a colleague they are even more open to objection.

It is necessary that judicial decorum has to be maintained at all times and even where criticism is justified it must be in language of utmost restraint, keeping always in view that the person making the comment is also fallible.\u201d (emphasis supplied) 142) In State of M.P. vs. Nandlal Jaiswal (1986) 4 SCC 566 disparaging and derogatory remarks were made by the High 219Court against the State Government.

Alas! we are \u201call the common growth of the Mother Earth\u2019 \u2013 even those of us who wear the long robe\u201d.

They have hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions. They are warmed by the same winter and summer and by the same ideas as a layman is\u201d. 220\u201cIn the present case, however, as we have already noted in the earlier part of the judgment, whether the order passed by the appellant was correct or not, but the remarks made, strictures passed and directions issued by the learned Single Judge of the High Court against the appellant were improper, uncalled for and unwarranted. Apart from the fact that they were neither necessary for deciding the controversy raised before the Court nor an integral part of the judgment, in the facts and circumstances of the case, they were not justified. We, therefore, direct deletion of those remarks.\u201d 143) In line with the consistent view of this Court, we are of the considered view that the Division Bench could have avoided making such observations which directly or impliedly indicates towards impropriety in the functioning of the Court, appreciation of evidence by the learned Judge and/or any other ancillary matter.

Role of the Media and Press: 145) Mr. Ram Jethmalani, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant-Manu Sharma had been specifically targeted and maligned before and during the proceedings by the media, who proclaimed him as guilty despite even after his acquittal by the Trial Court. He took us through various news items that were published in English & 222Hindi dailies. He elaborated that \u201cJustice should not only be done, it should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.\u201d This common law rule can not be ignored. 146) Cardozo, one of the great Judges of American Supreme Court in his \u201cNature of the Judicial Process\u201d observed that the judges are subconsciously influenced by several forces. This Court has expressed a similar view in P.C. Sen In Re: AIR 1970 SC 1821 and Reliance Petrochemicals Ltd. v. Proprietors of Indian Express 1988 (4) SCC 592. 147) There is danger, of serious risk of prejudice if the media exercises an unrestricted and unregulated freedom such that it publishes photographs of the suspects or the accused before the identification parades are constituted or if the media publishes statements which out rightly hold the suspect or the accused guilty even before such an order has been passed by the Court. 148) Despite the significance of the print and electronic media in the present day, it", "index": 155, "file_name": "36237.pdf"}, {"chunk": "is not only desirable but least that is expected of the persons at the helm of affairs in the field, to ensure that trial by media does not hamper fair investigation by the investigating agency and more importantly does not 223prejudice the right of defence of the accused in any manner whatsoever.

It is unfortunate that trial by media did, though to a very limited extent, affect the accused, but not tantamount to a prejudice which should weigh with the Court in taking any different view. The freedom of speech protected under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution has to be carefully and cautiously used, so as to avoid interference in the administration of justice and leading to undesirable results in the matters sub judice before the Courts. 150) A Bench of this Court in the case of R.K. Anand v. Delhi High Court (2009) 8 SCC 106, clearly stated it would be a sad day for the court to employ the media for setting its own house in order and the media too would not relish the role of being the snoopers for the Court. Media should perform the 224acts of journalism and not as a special agency for the Court.

In that event, it will be opposed to the very basic rule of law and would impinge upon the protection granted to an accused under Article 21 of the Constitution [Anukul Chandra Pradhan v. Union of India & Ors. (1996) 6 SCC 354]. It is essential for the maintenance of dignity of Courts and is one of the cardinal principles of rule of law in a free democratic country, that the criticism or even the reporting particularly, in sub judice matters must be 225subjected to check and balances so as not to interfere with the administration of justice. 152) In the present case, various articles in the print media had appeared even during the pendency of the matter before the High Court which again gave rise to unnecessary controversies and apparently, had an effect of interfering with the administration of criminal justice. We would certainly caution all modes of media to extend their cooperation to ensure fair investigation, trial, defence of accused and non interference in the administration of justice in matters sub judice. 153) Summary of our Conclusion: 1) The appellate Court has all the necessary powers to re- evaluate the evidence let in before the trial Court as well as the conclusions reached.

Revision petitioner is alleged to have been directly involved in the murder of her mother-in-law in the year 2002, father-in-law", "index": 0, "file_name": "jolly-order-462188.pdf"}, {"chunk": "in 2004, her husband in the year 2011, her mother-in-law's brother in the year 2014, and the young daughter and the first wife of herCrl.R.P.

Roy Thomas, alleged to have been committed on 30.9.2011. 3. After investigation, a final report was filed alleging offences under sections 110, 120(b), 465, 467, 468, 471, 302 and section 201 r/w section 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short 'IPC') apart from section 2 r/w section 6(2) of the Poisons Act, 1919. According to the prosecution, utilizing the cyanide procured through the second and third accused, the first accused had, on 30.9.2011, mixed the poison in a dish served for dinner and with water. Her husband ate the food and drank the water kept on the table and died. Later the first accused destroyed the evidence by cleaning the vessel and the glass. The prosecution also alleges that the first accused along with the fourth accused had forged a Will of her father-in-law and used that forged Will for effecting mutation of the property and thus the accused committed the offences alleged. 4. After the case was committed to the Court of Sessions, on realising the commission of offences triable exclusively by a Court of Session, the first accused (hereinafter referred to as 'revisionCrl.R.P.

It is also alleged that except for few statements made under the influence and threats of the investigating agency, no documentary evidence is available in the prosecution case to connect the revision petitioner with the offence and the allegation of an attempt to acquire property as a motive for the murder, is without any basis. 6.

The prosecution opposed the application for discharge. The learned Sessions Judge by order dated 15.12.2022 dismissed the petition after coming to the conclusion that the materials produced by the prosecution prima facie reveal incriminating materials against the revision petitioner for framing a charge under the various provisions of law alleged. 9. Sri. Biju Antony Aloor, learned counsel for the revision petitioner vehemently argued that the learned Sessions Judge egregiously erred in dismissing the application for discharge in a perfunctory manner without even referring to the specific contentions raised. It was also argued that the prosecution case does not create a strong suspicion against the revision petitioner and that she has been arrayed as an accused without any basis and hence the revision petitioner ought to be discharged.

I have considered the rival contentions and have also perused the documents handed over across the Bar by the learned counsel. 12. Revision petitioner is facing prosecution for the alleged murder of her husband. Three other accused are also arrayed along with the revision petitioner. The death of revision petitioner's first husband is alleged to have taken place on 20.9.2011. The post- mortem report dated 01.10.2011 reveals that death was due to cyanide poisoning and the report of chemical analysis was awaited at that point of time. The chemical analysis of the poison found in the body of the revision petitioner's husband also revealed the existence of poison. Thus, the death of revision petitioner's husband is primaCrl.R.P. No.925 /22 -:8:- facie due to poisoning. The contentions to the contrary raised by the revision petitioner are without any basis and those are all matters of proof, which can be adjudicated only during a trial. 13. The prosecution relies upon the statements of 255 witnesses and 356 documents are proposed to be marked apart from 22 material objects. Though the murder allegedly committed in 2011 came to light only in 2019, that by itself cannot detract the value of the material collected by the prosecution at this stage, since the probative value of the material collected by the prosecution can be tested only at the stage of trial. 14. However, for the limited purpose of appreciating whether a strong suspicion can arise from the material collected by the prosecution to consider whether the accused is liable to be discharged or not, it is sufficient to mention that the prosecution is relying upon the extra judicial confession of revision petitioner's own son, who is CW3, that of her", "index": 4, "file_name": "jolly-order-462188.pdf"}, {"chunk": "present husband CW5 and CW21. All the aforesaid witnesses have also given statements under section 164 of the Cr.P.C. A perusal of the extra judicial confession creates a strong suspicion as to the involvement of the revision petitioner in the crime. Revision petitioner's own son and her present husband haveCrl.R.P. No.925 /22 -:9:- deposed to the confession made by her regarding the murder of her husband and there is no material to doubt the sanctity of the said statements, at the stage of considering the petition for discharge. 15. In this context, the decision of the Supreme Court in Gura Singh v. State of Rajasthan [(2001) 2 SCC 205] is apposite. In the said decision, it was held that despite the inherent weakness of an extra judicial confession as an item of evidence, the said confession cannot be ignored when it is made by a person who had no reason to make such a false statement. It was also observed by the Supreme Court that if the extra judicial confession is true and voluntary, it can be relied upon by the court to convict the accused and if the confession is found to be true and voluntarily made, the same alone is sufficient to convict the accused. Reference in this context to the decision in Babu Issac v. State of Kerala [2020 (3) KLT 237] is also relevant. 16. Thus, it is glaring from the prosecution evidence that extra- judicial confession made by the revision petitioner to her immediate family members, who have no reason to foist a false case against her, stares at her face to create a strong suspicion. Whether the said statements are trustworthy and whether it requires any corroborationCrl.R.P.

Apart from the above, the statement of the accused that led to the recovery of cyanide, and the illicit relationship between accused 1 and 2, through whom she is alleged to have procured the cyanide, are all sufficient to prima facie create a strong suspicion of conspiracy to commit the murder. Even otherwise, the revision petitioner is alleged to have poisoned her husband and therefore even if it is assumed for argument's sake that conspiracy is not attracted, still the same is not a reason for the discharge of the revision petitioner. 17. Further, the fabrication of the signature of CW152 on the Will has been spoken to by him and whether the same is sufficient evidence or not can only be tested during trial. When prima facie there is evidence for the commission of forgery and the forged Will was used for effecting mutation, there is no reason as to why the revision petitioner should be discharged for the offences under sections 468 and 471 IPC. 18. In the decision in Central Bureau of Investigation, Hyderabad v. K.Narayana Rao [(2012) 9 SCC 512], the Supreme Court had laid down the following principles to be borne in mind whileCrl.R.P.

Those principles are: (i) The Judge while considering the question of framing the charges under Section 227, CrPC has the undoubted power to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the accused has been made out. The test to determine prima facie case would depend upon the facts of each case. (ii) Where the materials placed before the Court disclose grave suspicion against the accused which has not been properly explained, the Court will", "index": 6, "file_name": "jolly-order-462188.pdf"}, {"chunk": "be fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding with the trial. (iii) The Court cannot act merely as a post office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution but has to consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the documents produced before the Court, any basic infirmities, etc. However, at this stage, there cannot be roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial. (iv) If on the basis of the materials on record, the Court could form an opinion that the accused might have committed offence, it can frame the charge, though for conviction the conclusion is required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused has committed the offence. (v) At the time of framing of the charges, the probative value of the material on record cannot be gone into but before framing a charge the Court must apply its judicial mind on the material placed on record and must be satisfied that the commission of offence by the accused was possible. (vi) At the stage of Section 227 and 228, the Court is required to evaluate the material and documents on record with a view to find out if the facts emerging there from taken at their face value disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. For this limited purpose, sift the evidence as it cannot be expected even at that initial stage to accept all that the prosecution states as gospel truth even if it is opposed to common sense or the broad probabilities of the case. (vii) If two views are possible and one of them gives a right to suspicion only, as distinguished from grave suspicion, the trial Judge will", "index": 7, "file_name": "jolly-order-462188.pdf"}, {"chunk": "beCrl.R.P.

On an appreciation of the contentions raised and the circumstances adduced by the prosecution, this Court is of the considered view that there are sufficient materials to create a strong suspicion of the involvement of the revision petitioner in the murder of her husband. The circumstances adduced by the prosecution, if proved during trial, can certainly lead to the conviction of the revision petitioner for the offence of murder and the other offences alleged. The material and the documents on record and the statements made by various witnesses, if taken on face value, clearly disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting the various offences alleged. 20. In view of the above discussion, I am of the considered opinion that the conclusion arrived at by the learned Sessions Judge in dismissing the petition for discharge is legally tenable and does not warrant interference.

For all what is discussed hereinabove, and in deference to the standard of proof required for the purpose of section 8 of the Act supra and Rule 74 and in light of proof offered, it is held that birth certificate issued by Municipal Committee Hiranagar in favour of petitioner Shubam Sangra depicting his date of birth as 23-10-2002 is legitimate, un-tainted and fair and therefore credence needs to be given to it for the purpose of Juvenile Justice Act supra. Reckoning date of birth of petitioner as 23- 10-2002, it is held that age of petitioner as on date of passing of this order is less than sixteen years.

Rule 74 is with respect to the 29determination of age. Although what is relevant for our purpose is sub-rule (3) of Rule 74 of the Rules, 2014, yet we deem it appropriate to reproduce the entire Rule 74, which reads thus: \u201c74. Determination of age.\u2014(1) Whenever an alleged offender who appears to be below the age of 21 years is produced before a Court not being the Board, it shall on the very first date of production question the alleged offender about his age, satisfy itself that he is not a juvenile, make a note of its findings and order immediate transfer of the matter to the Board where necessary.

In the last, the learned senior counsel submitted that the case on hand is one of a very heinous crime committed on a minor girl aged 08 years. He would submit that if the plea of juvenility or the fact that the accused had not attained the age of discretion so as to understand the consequences of his heinous act is not free from ambiguity or doubt, such plea cannot be allowed to be raised merely on doubtful certificates evidencing age and in such circumstances the medical evidence will have to be given due weightage while determining the age of the accused. In the aforesaid context, the learned senior counsel placed strong reliance on the decision of this Court in Ramdeo Chauhan alias Raj Nath v. State of Assam, (2001) 5 SCC 714. 33. In such circumstances referred to above, Mr. Patwalia, the learned senior counsel prayed that there being merit in his appeal, the same be allowed and the impugned order passed by the High Court be set aside and it be held that the respondent was not a juvenile on the date of the commission of the offence.

He submitted that howsoever the heinous crime may be but on the date of commission of the alleged offence if the accused is a juvenile then he has to be tried as a juvenile in accordance with law and not like any other accused. He would submit that heinousness or brutality of the crime has nothing to do with the object of the Juvenile Justice Act. He further argued that no reliance could be placed on the opinion of the medical board because ultimately it is an expert opinion and cannot be said to be conclusive as regards the age. The learned counsel vehemently submitted that the court may take notice of the relevant fact that there is no certificate / document in the case on hand which indicates that the respondent was not a minor or a major as on the date of the alleged offence. He argued that in the event the school record (Admission Form) indicating the date of birth is not be treated as falling in the category 33mentioned in sub-rule (3) (ii) of Rule 74, then in view of the Order No. 22/JC/certificate issued by the Municipal Committee being available, recourse to Rule 74(3)(ii) is not at all warranted. 35.

The materials on record as looked into by us above reveal no manner of doubt that there are discrepancies in the certificates on record disclosing the date of birth of the respondent. We fail to understand as to why the Courts below were not able to take cognizance of such discrepancies or contradictions. We are not at all impressed with the submission canvassed on behalf of the respondent that even if there are contradictions or discrepancies in the documentary evidence of record there is not a single date emerging on record on the basis of which it could be said that the respondent was major on the date of the alleged offence. It is a very unreasonable argument. That is not the correct way of looking at the", "index": 29, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "core issue. The correct way of looking at the core issue is to closely examine whether there is any cogent or convincing evidence as regards the correct date of birth of the respondent accused and after ascertaining the same, reach to an appropriate conclusion. If, there is any doubt in this regard, there is no good reason why the matter should not be referred to a duly constituted medical board which shall, in turn, record its findings and submit to the Juvenile Justice Board. The word 35\u201cmay\u201d should be read as \u201cshall\u201d having regard to the very object of sub-rule (3) of Rule 74. 39. It is a well settled principle of interpretation that the word \u2018may\u2019 when used in a legislation by itself does not connote a directory meaning. If in a particular case, in the interests of equity and justice it appears to the court that the intent of the legislature is to convey a statutory duty, then the use of the word \u2018may\u2019 will not prevent the court from giving it a mandatory colour. This Court in Bachahan Devi v. Nagar Nigam, Gorakhpur reported in (2008) 12 SCC 372, held as under: \u201c18. It is well settled that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in a statutory provision would not by itself show that the provision is directory in nature. In some cases, the legislature may use the word \u201cmay\u201d as a matter of pure conventional courtesy and yet intend a mandatory force. In order, therefore, to interpret the legal import of the word \u201cmay\u201d, the court has to consider various factors, namely, the object and the scheme of the Act, the context and the background against which the words have been used, the purpose and the advantages sought to be achieved by the use of this", "index": 30, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "word, and the like. It is equally well settled that where the word \u201cmay\u201d involves a discretion coupled with an obligation or where it confers a positive benefit to a general class of subjects in a utility Act, or where the court advances a remedy and suppresses the mischief, or where giving the words directory significance would defeat the very object of the Act, the word \u201cmay\u201d should be interpreted to convey a mandatory force. As a general rule, the word \u201cmay\u201d is permissive and operative to confer discretion and especially so, where it is used in juxtaposition to the word \u201cshall\u201d, which ordinarily is imperative as it imposes a duty. Cases, however, are not wanting where the words \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d are used 36interchangeably. In order to find out whether these words are being used in a directory or in a mandatory sense, the intent of the legislature should be looked into along with the pertinent circumstances.\u201d 40. Similarly, this Court in Dhampur Sugar Mills Ltd. v. State of U.P. reported in (2007) 8 SCC 338, held: \u201c36. \u2026.In our judgment, mere use of word \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d is not conclusive. The question whether a particular provision of a statute is directory or mandatory cannot be resolved by laying down any general rule of universal application. Such controversy has to be decided by ascertaining the intention of the legislature and not by looking at the language in which the provision is clothed. And for finding out the legislative intent, the court must examine the scheme of the Act, purpose and object underlying the provision, consequences likely to ensue or inconvenience likely to result if the provision is read one way or the other and many more considerations relevant to the issue.\u201d 41.

Section 8 provides for the procedure to be followed, when the claim of juvenility is raised before any court. Section 8 reads thus: \u201c8.

The plain reading of Section 8 referred to above indicates that whenever a claim of juvenility is raised before any court or the court is of the opinion that the accused person was a juvenile on the date of the commission of the offence, then it is mandatory for the court to make an inquiry and in the course of such", "index": 32, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "inquiry, the court may take such evidence as may be necessary, however, not an affidavit, so as to determine the age of such person.

We may also look into Section 48 of the Act, 2013. Section 48 is in regard to the presumption and determination of age. Section 48 reads thus: \u201c48.

However, what is relevant to note is that in both the Sections i.e., Section 8 as well as Section 48 the word \u2018shall\u2019 has been used. 45. There is one another aspect of this matter. It is the High Court who thought fit to pass the order dated 21.02.2018 referred to by us in para 9 as above, directing the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to take steps for ascertaining the age of the respondent herein. It is pursuant to such 39directions issued by the High Court that a Special Medical Board comprising of five medical experts on different subjects was constituted and it is this medical board comprising of five medical experts whose report we are looking into so far as the approximate age of the respondent is concerned. When we have reached to the conclusion that there is no cogent and convincing documentary evidence on record as regards the date of birth or age of the respondent accused on the date of the alleged crime then there is no good reason for us not to look into or ignore the medical report prepared by the Special Medical Board which is on record. In such circumstances, the argument canvassed on behalf of the respondent in regard to the applicability of sub-rule (3)(iii) of Rule 74 pales into insignificance. In other words, the argument that the Special Medical Board should not have been constituted pales into insignificance because the Special Board was constituted under the directions issued by the High Court. 46. Let us see what this Court has to say in the case of Darga Ram @ Gunga (supra) upon which strong reliance has been placed on behalf of the learned counsel appearing for the respondent accused. In Darga Ram @ Gunga (supra), this Court held as", "index": 34, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "under: \u201c16. The medical opinion given by the duly constituted Board comprising Professors of Anatomy, Radiodiagnosis and 40Forensic Medicine has determined his age to be \u201cabout\u201d 33 years on the date of the examination. The Board has not been able to give the exact age of the appellant on medical examination, no matter the advances made in that field. That being so, in terms of Rule 12(3)(b) the appellant may even be entitled to the benefit of fixing his age on the lower side within a margin of one year in case the Court considers it necessary to do so in the facts and circumstances of the case. The need for any such statutory concession may not however arise because even if the estimated age as determined by the Medical Board is taken as the correct/true age of the appellant he was just about 17 years and 2 months old on the date of the occurrence and thus a juvenile within the meaning of that expression as used in the Act aforementioned. Having said that we cannot help observing that we have not felt very comfortable with the Medical Board estimating the age of the appellant in a range of 30 to 36 years as on the date of the medical examination. 17. The general rule about age determination is that the age as determined can vary plus minus two years but the Board has in the case at hand spread over a period of six years and taken a mean to fix the age of the appellant at 33 years. We are not sure whether that is the correct way of estimating the age of the appellant. What reassures us about the estimate of age is the fact that the same is determined by a Medical Board comprising Professors", "index": 35, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "of Anatomy, Radiodiagnosis and Forensic Medicine whose opinion must get the respect it deserves.

Taking his age as 34 years on the date of the examination he would have been 18 years, 2 months and 7 days on the date of the occurrence but such an estimate would be only an estimate and the appellant may be entitled to additional benefit of one year in terms of lowering his age by 41one year in terms of Rule 12(3)(b) (supra) which would then bring him to be 17 years and 2 months old, therefore, a juvenile.\u201d 47. On the other hand, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant State submitted that Darga Ram @ Gunga (supra) came to be considered by this Court in the case of Mukarrab v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2017) 2 SCC 210, and this Court in Mukarrab (supra) observed as under: \u201c22. A reading of the above decision in Darga Ram case (supra) shows that courts need to be aware of the fact that age determination of the persons concerned cannot be certainly ascertained in the absence of original and valid documentary proof and there would always lie a possibility that the age of the person concerned may vary plus or minus two years. Even in the presence of medical opinion, the Court showed a tilt towards the juvenility of the accused. However, it is pertinent to note that such an approach in Darga Ram case (supra) was taken in the specific facts and circumstances of that", "index": 36, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "particular case and any attempt of generalising the said approach could not be justifiably entertained.\u201d 48. Thus, in Mukarrab (supra), this Court made itself clear that Darga Ram @ Gunga (supra) was rendered in the peculiar facts & circumstances of that case & any attempt of generalizing the said approach could not be justifiably entertained. 49. Before we proceed further, we may clarify that Darga Ram @ Gunga (supra), was under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) 42Act, 2000 (for short, \u2018the Act, 2000\u2019). We may give a fair idea in regard to the scheme of procedure to be followed, when claim of juvenility is raised under the Act, 2000. 50. Section 7A of the Act, 2000 reads as under: \u201c7A. Procedure to be followed when claim of juvenility is raised before any Court- (1) Whenever a claim of juvenility is raised before any court or a court is of the opinion that an accused person was a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence, the court shall make an inquiry, take such evidence as may be necessary (but not an affidavit) so as to determine the age of such person, and shall record a finding whether the person is a juvenile or a child or not, stating his age as nearly as may be: Provided that a claim of juvenility may be raised before any Court and it shall be recognised at any stage, even after final disposal of the case, and such claim shall be determined in terms of the provisions contained in this Act and the rules made thereunder, even if the juvenile has ceased to be so on or before the date of commencement of this Act. (2) If the court finds a person to be a juvenile on the date of", "index": 37, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "commission of the offence under sub-section (1), it shall forward the juvenile to the Board for passing appropriate orders and the sentence, if any, passed by a court shall be deemed to have no effect.\u201d 51. From a reading of Section 7A, what becomes very obvious is that whenever a claim of juvenility is raised, an inquiry has to be made and such inquiry would take place by receiving evidence which would be necessary but not an affidavit so as to determine the age of such person. 4352. The procedure to be followed for the determination of age is provided under Rule 12(3)(b) of the 2007 Rules, which reads as: \u201c12. Procedure to be followed in determination of age.\u2014(3) In every case concerning a child or juvenile in conflict with law, the age determination inquiry shall be conducted by the court or the Board or, as the case may be, the Committee by seeking evidence by obtaining\u2014 (a)(i) the matriculation or equivalent certificates, if available; and in the absence whereof; (ii) the date of birth certificate from the school (other than a play school) first attended; and in the absence whereof; (iii) the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat; (b) and only in the absence of either (i), (ii) or (iii) of clause (a) above, the medical opinion will be sought from a duly constituted Medical Board, which will declare the age of the juvenile or child. In case exact assessment of the age cannot be done, the Court or the Board or, as the case may be, the Committee, for the reasons to be recorded by them, may, if considered necessary, give benefit to the child or juvenile by considering his/her age on lower side within the margin of one year. and,", "index": 38, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "while passing orders in such case shall, after taking into consideration such evidence as may be available, or the medical opinion, as the case may be, record a finding in respect of his age and either of the evidence specified in any of the clauses (a)(i), (ii), (iii) or in the absence whereof, clause (b) shall be the conclusive proof of the age as regards such child or the juvenile in conflict with law.\u201d 53. Sub-clause (3) of the aforesaid Rule clearly mandates that while conducting an inquiry about the juvenility of an accused, the Juvenile 44Justice Board would seek evidence by obtaining the matriculation or equivalent certificates and in the absence whereof the date of birth certificate from the school first attended and in absence whereof the birth certificate given by a corporation or a Municipal authority or a Panchayat.

Ashwani Kumar Saxena (supra), referred to above, also deals with the Act, 2000. 57.

Thereafter the Court proceeded to hold that the procedure to be followed under the Juvenile Justice Act in conducting the inquiry is the procedure as laid down in that statute itself i.e. Rule 12 of 2007 Rules and held that the age determination inquiry contemplated under the Juvenile Justice Act and the Rules had nothing to do with the inquiry under other legislations like entry in service, retirement and promotion. The Court observed that where the entry made in the school certificates is available, the Court or the Juvenile Justice Board is not expected to conduct a roving inquiry and go beyond those certificates to examine their correctness when those documents have been kept during the normal course of business. The Court held that the credibility and acceptability of the documents, including the school leaving certificate, would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no hard and fast rule as such could be laid down in that regard. This Court also held that the certificates should not be viewed as doubtful on a notion that the parents 46usually get wrong date of birth entered in the", "index": 40, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "admission registers. The decision of Ashwani Kumar Saxena (supra) has been pressed hard in service by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent to make good his submission that the Court should not conduct a roving inquiry and go beyond the documentary evidence on record. 58. This Court in Rishipal Singh Solanki v. State of U.P., (2022) 8 SCC 602, after due consideration of its following earlier decisions,: (i) Parag Bhati v. State of U.P., (2016) 12 SCC 744, (ii) Sanjeev Kumar Gupta v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2019) 12 SCC 370, (iii) Abuzar Hossain @ Gulam Hossain v.

State of Jharkhand, 47(2006) 9 SCC 428. pointed out the difference in the procedure under the two enactments, i.e., the Act, 2000 and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (for short, \u2018the Act, 2015\u2019), as to the inquiry into determination of age of the juvenile and also the power to seek evidence, how and when to exercise that power and when to go for the ossification test. This Court held that each case may be dealt with in the light of its own peculiar facts and circumstances while keeping certain principles as the guiding factor in mind as described in the concluding para of the judgment of this Court. We shall reproduce the concluding para a little later. 59. In Rishipal Singh Solanki (supra), this Court pointed out the similarity between the Rule 12 of the JJ Rules, 2007 and sub-section (2) of Section 94 of the Act,", "index": 41, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "2015, as substantive provisions. This Court referred to its decisions in Ashwani Kumar Saxena (supra) and Abuzar Hossain @ Gulam Hossain (supra) highlighting the fact that only in the cases where certificates are found to be fabricated and manipulated, the Juvenile Justice Board need to go for medical report and also highlighted the fact that the yardstick for relying on the school certificates may be a bit different 48where the school leaving certificate or voter list etc. is obtained after conviction. 60. Thus, this Court kept in mind the facts and circumstances attached to the production of documents/certificates, as required by the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act before those documents could be relied upon. In other words, even if the documents are found to be prima facie correct, there may be facts and circumstances to alert the Court to go into the inquiry to satisfy itself as to correctness of the claim. In the same breath, this Court referred to an opinion given in the judgment of Abuzar Hossain @ Gulam Hossain (supra) that when any claimant or any of the parents or siblings in support of the claim of the juvenility raised for the first time in appeal or revision depends on mere affidavits, it shall not be sufficient to justify the inquiry for determination of age unless there exist circumstances which cannot be ignored. 61. In Sanjeev Kumar Gupta (supra), the credibility and authenticity of the matriculation certificate for the purpose of determination of age under Section 7(A) of the Act, 2000 came up for consideration. In the said case, the Juvenile Justice Board had rejected the claim of the juvenility and that decision of the Juvenile Justice Board was restored by this Court by rejecting the order of the High Court.

It was observed that the date of birth reflected in the matriculation certification could not be accepted as authentic or credible. In the said case, it was held that the date of birth of the second respondent there was 17.12.1995 and that he was not entitled to claim juvenility as the date of the alleged incident was 18.08.2015. 62. This Court in Sanjeev Kumar Gupta (supra) considered the judgments in Ashwani Kumar Saxena (supra) and Abuzar Hossain @ Gulam Hossain (supra), and observed that the credibility and acceptability of the documents including the school leaving certificate would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no hard and fast rule as such could be laid down in that regard.

In Rishipal Singh Solanki (supra), after due consideration of all its earlier decisions, this Court held as below: \u201c33. What emerges on a cumulative consideration of the aforesaid catena of judgments is as follows: 33.1. A claim of juvenility may be raised at any stage of a criminal proceeding, even after a final disposal of the case. A delay in raising the claim of juvenility cannot be a ground for rejection of such claim. It can also be raised for the first time before this Court. 33.2. An application claiming juvenility could be made either before the Court or the JJ Board. 33.2.1. When the issue of juvenility arises before a Court, it would be under sub-section (2) and (3) of section 9 of the JJ Act, 2015 but when a person is brought before a Committee or JJ Board, section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 applies. 33.2.2. If an application is filed before the Court claiming juvenility, the provision of sub-section (2) of section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 would have to be applied or read along with sub- section (2) of section 9 so as to seek evidence for the purpose of 51recording a finding stating the age of the person as nearly as may be. 33.2.3. When an application claiming juvenility is made under section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 before the JJ Board when the matter regarding the alleged commission of offence is pending before a Court, then the procedure contemplated under section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 would apply. Under the said provision if the JJ Board has reasonable grounds for doubt regarding whether the person brought before it is a child or not, the Board shall undertake the process of age determination", "index": 44, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "by seeking evidence and the age recorded by the JJ Board to be the age of the person so brought before it shall, for the purpose of the JJ Act, 2015, be deemed to be true age of that person. Hence the degree of proof required in such a proceeding before the JJ Board, when an application is filed seeking a claim of juvenility when the trial is before the concerned criminal court, is higher than when an inquiry is made by a court before which the case regarding the commission of the offence is pending (vide section 9 of the JJ Act, 2015). 33.3. That when a claim for juvenility is raised, the burden is on the person raising the claim to satisfy the Court to discharge the initial burden. However, the documents mentioned in Rule 12(3) (a)(i), (ii), and (iii) of the JJ Rules 2007 made under the JJ Act, 2000 or sub-section (2) of section 94 of JJ Act, 2015, shall be sufficient for prima facie satisfaction of the Court. On the basis of the aforesaid documents a presumption of juvenility may be raised. 33.4. The said presumption is however not conclusive proof of the age of juvenility and the same may be rebutted by contra evidence let in by the opposite side. 33.5. That the procedure of an inquiry by a Court is not the same thing as declaring the age of the person as a juvenile sought before the JJ Board when the case is pending for trial before the concerned criminal court. In case of an inquiry, the Court records a prima facie conclusion but when there is a determination of age as per sub-section (2) of section 94 of 2015 Act, a 52declaration is made on the basis of evidence.

Thus, the standard of proof in an inquiry is different from that required in a proceeding where the determination and declaration of the age of a person has to be made on the basis of evidence scrutinised and accepted only if worthy of such acceptance. 33.6. That it is neither feasible nor desirable to lay down an abstract formula to determine the age of a person. It has to be on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by the parties in each case. 33.7. This Court has observed that a hyper- technical approach should not be adopted when evidence is adduced on behalf of the accused in support of the plea that he was a juvenile. 33.8. If two views are possible on the same evidence, the court should lean in favour of holding the accused to be a juvenile in borderline cases. This is in order to ensure that the benefit of the JJ Act, 2015 is made applicable to the juvenile in conflict with law. At the same time, the Court should ensure that the JJ Act, 2015 is not misused by persons to escape punishment after having committed serious offences. 33.9. That when the determination of age is on the basis of evidence such as school records, it is necessary that the same would have to be considered as per Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act, inasmuch as any public or official document maintained in the discharge of official duty would have greater credibility than private documents. 33.10.

Such evidence is not conclusive evidence but only a very useful guiding factor to be considered in the absence of documents mentioned in Section 94(2) of the JJ Act, 2015.\u201d 65. Rishipal Singh Solanki (supra) is under the Act, 2015. 66.

(2) In case, the Committee or the Board has reasonable grounds for doubt regarding whether the person brought before it is a child or not, the Committee or the Board, as the case may be, shall undertake the process of age determination, by seeking evidence by obtaining \u2014 (i) the date of birth certificate from the school, or the matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned examination Board, if available; and in the absence thereof; (ii) the birth certificate", "index": 47, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat; (iii) and only in the absence of (i) and (ii) above, age shall be determined by an ossification test or any other latest medical age determination test conducted on the orders of the Committee or the Board: 54Provided such age determination test conducted on the order of the Committee or the Board shall be completed within fifteen days from the date of such order. (3) The age recorded by the Committee or the Board to be the age of person so brought before it shall, for the purpose of this Act, be deemed to be the true age of that person.\u201d 67. This Court after referring to the fact that there was no other document contradicting the date of birth as shown in the matriculation certificate, held that the medical evidence was not required and thereby upheld the order of the High Court affirming the judgment of the Sessions Court as well as the Juvenile Justice Board. Thus, the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent accused should be looked into and appreciated as aforesaid. The decisions do not help the respondent accused in any manner. On the contrary, the ratio discernable from all the decisions discussed above, is that the credibility and acceptability of the documents including the school leaving certificate etc. would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no hard and fast rule as such could be laid in that regard. 68. In Parag Bhati (supra), after referring to Abuzar Hossain case (supra) and other decisions, this Court held as under: \u201c34. It is no doubt true that if there is a clear and unambiguous case in favour of the juvenile accused that he was a minor below the", "index": 48, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "age of 18 years on the date of the 55incident and the documentary evidence at least prima facie proves the same, he would be entitled to the special protection under the JJ Act.

The benefit of the principle of benevolent legislation attached to the JJ Act would thus apply to only such cases wherein the accused is held to be a juvenile on the basis of at least prima facie evidence regarding his minority as the benefit of the possibilities of two views in regard to the age of the alleged accused who is involved in grave and serious offence which he committed and gave effect to it in a well- planned manner reflecting his maturity of mind rather than innocence indicating that his plea of juvenility is more in the nature of a shield to dodge or dupe the arms of law, cannot be allowed to come to his rescue.\u201d (emphasis added) The dictum of the aforesaid is that the purpose of the Act, 2000 is not to give shelter to the accused of grave and heinous offences. 69. This Court in several of its decisions including Ramdeo Chauhan alias Raj Nath (supra) dealing with a similar situation which fortifies what we have stated, observed as follows: 56\u201c\u2026\u2026.. it is clear that the petitioner neither was a child nor near about the age of", "index": 49, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "being a child within the meaning of the Juvenile Justice Act or the Children Act.

It is true that the accused tried to create a smokescreen with respect to his age but such efforts appear to have been made only to hide his real age and not to create any doubt in our mind. The judicial system cannot be allowed to be taken to ransom by having resort to imaginative and concocted grounds by taking advantage of loose sentences appearing in the evidence of some of the witnesses, particularly at the stage of special leave petition. The law insists on finality of judgments and is more concerned with the strengthening of the judicial system. The courts are enjoined upon to perform their duties with the object of strengthening the confidence of the common man in the institution entrusted with the administration of justice. Any effort which weakens the system and shakes the faith of the common man in the justice dispensation system has to be discouraged.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) 70. The above-noted observations in Ramdeo Chauhan alias Raj Nath (supra) no doubt were recorded by the learned Judges of this Court while considering the imposition of death sentence on the accused who claimed to be a juvenile, nevertheless the views expressed therein clearly lend weight for resolving an issue where the court is not in a position to clearly draw an inference wherein an attempt is made by the accused or his guardian claiming benefit available to a juvenile which may be an effort to 57extract sympathy and", "index": 50, "file_name": "43077_2019_1_1501_39777_Judgement_16-Nov-2022.pdf"}, {"chunk": "impress upon the court for a lenient treatment towards the so-called juvenile accused who, in fact was a major on the date of incident.

Similarly, if the conduct of an accused or the method and manner of commission of the offence indicates an evil and a well-planned design of the accused committing the offence which indicates more towards the matured skill of an accused than that of an innocent child, then in the absence of reliable documentary evidence in support of the age of the accused, medical evidence indicating that the accused was a major cannot be allowed to be ignored taking shelter of the principle of benevolent legislation like the Juvenile Justice Act, subverting the course of justice as statutory protection of the Juvenile Justice Act is meant for minors who are innocent law-breakers and not the accused of matured mind who use the plea of minority as a ploy or shield to protect himself from the sentence of the offence committed by him. 34. The benefit of benevolent legislation under the Juvenile Justice Act obviously will offer protection to a genuine child accused/juvenile who does not put the court into any dilemma as to whether he is a juvenile or not by adducing evidence in support of his plea of minority but in absence of the same, reliance placed merely on shaky evidence like the school admission register which is not proved or oral evidence based on conjectures leading to further ambiguity, cannot be relied upon in preference to the medical evidence for assessing the age of the accused. 35.

In Ramdeo Chauhan alias Raj Nath v. State of Assam [(2001) 5 SCC 714 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 915] , the learned Judges have added an insight for determination of this issue when they recorded as follows: (SCC p. 720 d-e) \u201cOf course the doctor's estimate of age is not a sturdy substitute for proof as it is only his opinion. But such opinion of an expert cannot be sidelined in the realm where the court gropes in the dark to find out what would possibly have been the age of a citizen for the purpose of affording him a constitutional protection. In the absence of all other acceptable materials, if such opinion points to a reasonable possibility regarding the range of his age it has certainly to be considered.\u201d (emphasis supplied) The situation, however, would be different if the academic records are alleged to have been withheld deliberately to hide the age of the alleged juvenile and the authenticity of the medical evidence is under challenge at the instance of the prosecution. In that event, whether the medical evidence should be relied upon or not will obviously depend on the value of the evidence led by the contesting parties. 37.

We are under constraint to observe that this will have to be discouraged if the evidence and other materials on record fail to prove that the accused was a juvenile at the time of commission of the offence. 38. The Juvenile Justice Act which is certainly meant to treat a child accused with care and sensitivity offering him a chance to reform and settle into the mainstream of society, the same cannot be allowed to be used as a ploy to dupe the course of justice while conducting the trial and treatment of heinous offences.

We may only add that there are better techniques available and are used for determination of age across the world. For example, the United States Immigration Department uses \u2018wisdom teeth\u2019 technique for determination of age. Under this technique, the doctors examine the third molar which usually erupts between 17 to 25 years of age. The average error, in this technique is also significantly lower than the ossification of any other bone. Another technique is \u2018epigenetic clock\u2019 technique. The Epigenetic clock is DNA clock which measures DNA methylation levels to estimate the age of a tissue or an organ. The median error in this 62technique can be reduced to less than four weeks. What we are trying to convey is that such techniques should be introduced in our country as well.

In the absence of all other acceptable materials, if such opinion of the experts points to a reasonable possibility regarding range of his age, the Court must consider the same in the interest of justice. This is not a case wherein the appellant State has been accused of deliberately withholding the necessary records only with a view to hide or conceal the age of the alleged juvenile and the authenticity of the medical evidence is challenged at the instance of the prosecution.

At the cost of repetition, the only argument is that ignore the medical report as there is proof of the date of birth to be found in the various documents on record.

The President of India rejected the mercy petition on 01.02.2020 and the same was communicated to the petitioner in Tihar Central Jail on 01.02.2020. 4. On 31.01.2020, learned Sessions Judge passed an order postponing the execution of the death warrant.

Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner Vinay Sharma challenged the rejection of his mercy petition by the President of India contending that the Lieutenant Governor and Home Minister, NCT of Delhi have not signed the recommendation for rejection of", "index": 1, "file_name": "5529_2020_5_301_20686_Judgement_14-Feb-2020.pdf"}, {"chunk": "the petitioner\u2019s mercy plea. It was submitted that the relevant materials like the case records, correct medical status report of the petitioner, Social Investigation Report and the nominal roll of the petitioner were not placed before the President of India and the concerned authorities and these documents were kept out of consideration and only irrelevant materials were placed before the President of India which according to the learned counsel, vitiates the order of rejection of mercy petition. As per Dr. A.P. Singh, he approached the respondents authorities that is office of the President of India, Lieutenant Governor, Ministry of Home Affairs and the Department of Home, Govt. of NCT of Delhi under the Right to Information Act, 2005 and filed RTI application requesting for records pertaining to the rejection of the mercy petition of the petitioner; however, the same have not been furnished to nor was there any reply to his application. However, the learned counsel submitted that he was permitted to peruse the relevant file. According to the learned counsel, without access to the records, the petitioner cannot 4exercise his right under Article 21 of the Constitution and he cannot challenge the order rejecting his mercy petition. 6. It is the further argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that petitioner Vinay Sharma was only 19 years old and is not a habitual offender and hails from lower class of society and these aspects could have been considered only by a thorough Social Investigation Report which was not placed before the President of India. 7. The learned counsel submitted that the petitioner was kept in solitary confinement even while his mercy petition was still pending before the President of India and such illegal confinement was unfair and in violation of Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration and Others (1978)", "index": 2, "file_name": "5529_2020_5_301_20686_Judgement_14-Feb-2020.pdf"}, {"chunk": "4 SCC 494 and this becomes a ground for commutation of death sentence. It was further urged that the petitioner was tortured in the jail not only physically and there were also mental tortures and on number of days, petitioner Vinay Sharma was sent to medical treatment and also for psychological treatment. It is the claim of the learned counsel that the petitioner has been on psychological medication and diagnosed with the adjustment disorder and that as per Delhi Prisons Rules, the petitioner should have been provided with proper care and 5treatment for mental illness and on the basis of the medical records. It is the claim of the learned counsel that the prisoners with medical illness and mental illness cannot be executed in terms of the UN General Assembly Resolutions as referred to in Shatrughan Chauhan and Another v. Union of India and Others (2014) 3 SCC 1 and other Union Treaties. 8. Countering the above arguments, Mr. Tushar Mehta, the learned Solicitor General has submitted that all the relevant materials were placed before the concerned authorities and the mercy petition was forwarded to the President of India along with all those documents including the details of the court cases, records of the case, medical record, Social Investigation Report. It was submitted that the mercy petition along with the relevant documents was received by the Ministry of Home Affairs who have perused and with the appropriate note file, thereafter documents were placed before the President of India with a detailed Note File. Insofar as the alleged medical illness/mental illness of the petitioner, learned Solicitor General submitted that the petitioner was regularly checked and the Medical Officer In-Charge, Central Jail Hospital has issued the medical report stating that the petitioner was psychologically well adjusted and his general condition is stable", "index": 3, "file_name": "5529_2020_5_301_20686_Judgement_14-Feb-2020.pdf"}, {"chunk": "and the medical 6report of the petitioner has been placed before the President of India. Drawing our attention to the affidavit filed by the Director General (Prisons), Tihar Jail, it was submitted that the petitioner was never placed in solitary confinement and was placed in a single room with iron bars and the petitioner intermittently mingled with other prisoners. The learned Solicitor General submitted that the scope of judicial review of the order passed by the President of India is very limited and the contentions urged on behalf of the petitioner would not fall within the grounds of review as laid down by various judgments of this Court and prayed for dismissal of the writ petition. 9. In this writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioner challenges the order of rejection of his mercy petition by the President of India inter alia on various grounds that the settled principles of consideration of mercy petition have not been followed and that the relevant materials were not placed before the President of India. 10. As per Article 72 of the Constitution, the President of India shall have the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence. As per Article 772(1)(c) of the Constitution, the power is inclusive of commutation in cases where the sentence is a sentence of death. Under Article 161 of the Constitution, similar is the power of the Governor to give relief to any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the State extends.

As held in Devender Pal Singh Bhullar v. State of (NCT of Delhi) (2013) 6 SCC 195 that the disposal of the mercy petitions filed under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution of India requires consideration of various factors. 11. The grounds for judicial review of rejection of mercy petition under Article 72 of the Constitution has been considered in Satpal v. State of Haryana (2000) 5 SCC 170 and the Constitution Bench judgment in Bikas Chatterjee v. Union of India and Others (2004) 7 SCC 634 and Shatrughan Chauhan. After referring to various decisions, the Supreme Court considered the power of the President of India or the Governor of the State under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution and observing that the power vested in the 8President of India under Article 72 and the Governor under Article 161 of the Constitution is a constitutional duty, in Shatrughan Chauhan, it was held as under:- \u201c14.

As a result, it is neither a matter of grace nor a matter of privilege but is an important constitutional responsibility reposed by the People in the highest authority. The power of pardon is essentially an executive action, which needs to be exercised in the aid of justice and not in defiance of it. Further, it is well settled that the power under Articles 72/161 of the Constitution of India is to be exercised on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.\u201d 12. In a number of decisions, the Supreme Court has taken the consistent view that the executive orders under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution should be subject to limited judicial review. In WP(Crl.) D No.3334 of 2020 - similar petition filed by co-accused Mukesh Kumar, we have referred to number of judgments which 9have elaborately considered the scope of judicial review of the decision of the President of India on a petition under Article 72 of the Constitution of India. It is not necessary to refer to all those decisions referred to in WP(Crl.) D No.3334 of 2020. Suffice to refer to the Epuru Sudhakar and Another v. Govt. of A.P. and Others (2006) 8 SCC 161 and Shatrughan Chauhan. In Epuru Sudhakar, the Court has referred to the various grounds available for limited judicial review under Article 72 of the Constitution, it was held as under:- \u201c34. The position, therefore, is undeniable that judicial review of the order of the President or the Governor under Article 72 or Article 161, as the case may be, is available and their orders", "index": 6, "file_name": "5529_2020_5_301_20686_Judgement_14-Feb-2020.pdf"}, {"chunk": "can be impugned on the following grounds: (a) that the order has been passed without application of mind; (b) that the order is mala fide; (c) that the order has been passed on extraneous or wholly irrelevant considerations; (d) that relevant materials have been kept out of consideration; (e) that the order suffers from arbitrariness. 35. Two important aspects were also highlighted by learned amicus curiae; one relating to the desirability of indicating reasons in the order granting pardon/remission while the other was an equally more important question relating to power to withdraw the order of granting pardon/remission, if subsequently, materials are placed to show that certain relevant materials were not considered or certain materials of extensive value were kept out of consideration.

Further, it is well settled that the power under Articles 72/161 of the Constitution of India is to be exercised on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.\u201d 14. In the light of the above principles, let us consider the present writ petition and the grounds urged by the petitioner. The petitioner has primarily raised the following grounds to challenge the order of rejection of his mercy petition:- 11(i) non-furnishing of copy of records pertaining to the rejection of the mercy petition of the petitioner under Right to Information Act, 2005; (ii) relevant materials were kept out of consideration; (iii) torture while in custody and consequential illness and mental illness of the petitioner and non-placing of materials pertaining to health condition of the petitioner; (iv) illegal solitary confinement; and (v) Bias order was passed with prejudiced mind. 15. Re. Contention: Records not made available to the petitioner under RTI Act : Learned counsel for the petitioner while seeking to put forth the contention would submit that he had made an application to the office of the President of India, Lieutenant Governor, Ministry of Home Affairs and the Department of Home, Govt. of NCT of Delhi under the Right to Information Act, 2005 seeking copies of certain documents from the file", "index": 8, "file_name": "5529_2020_5_301_20686_Judgement_14-Feb-2020.pdf"}, {"chunk": "which were relevant in the context of consideration of the mercy petition. However, the same has not been replied to. In that regard, the learned counsel contended that he was permitted to peruse the records and since the copies were not made available, he be permitted to peruse the original file and make his submissions in the court. Insofar as the grievance raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner that he had not been furnished copies under the Right to Information Act, we do not find it appropriate to advert to that aspect 12of the matter since it is beyond the scope of consideration in a petition of the present nature. 16. In the writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India seeking judicial review of the order of the President passed under Article 72 of the Constitution, the scope is very limited and the Court is called upon to examine:- (i) where the order has been passed without application of mind; (ii) where the order has been passed on extraneous or wholly irrelevant considerations; (iii) that relevant materials have been kept out of consideration; and (iv) the order suffers from arbitrariness. 17. Insofar as the contention by the learned counsel that the file be made available to him, we are of the opinion that even such a course would not be appropriate. During the course of hearing, we have rejected the request of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner that he should be permitted to peruse the file and then make the submission on behalf of the petitioner. In any event, we have heard learned counsel for the petitioner exhaustively and the contentions with regard to the alleged discrepancies which is said to have been observed by the learned counsel in the manner in", "index": 9, "file_name": "5529_2020_5_301_20686_Judgement_14-Feb-2020.pdf"}, {"chunk": "which the file had been processed and has been taken up for consideration. Having taken note of such contention, this Court 13thought it fit to look into the file to satisfy itself as to whether the procedure as contemplated has been followed. Accordingly, we have adopted that course. In that regard, from the file the learned Solicitor General has referred to the various documents/enclosures forwarded along with the mercy petition, nature of consideration made from the stage of receipt of the mercy petition and an appropriate note put at various stages was referred and the file relating to the same was made available to the Court. The consideration made by us is based on the contents of the file. In any event, as already indicated above, the issue with regard to the nature of documents required not being provided under the Right to Information Act would not arise, keeping in view the definite parameters under which the petition of the present nature is required to be considered. Further, since this Court has examined the file as indicated above, the petitioner cannot make grievance that because of the non-furnishing of the copy of the documents, prejudice is caused to them. 18. Re. Contention that the Lieutenant Governor, Delhi and Home Minister, Govt. of NCT of Delhi did not sign the relevant file:- Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that he was permitted to inspect the file and on such inspection, he has noticed 14that the Lieutenant Governor and Minister (Home), NCT of Delhi did not peruse the file and on the other hand, upon the message sent by an official, they have recommended the rejection of the mercy petition. It was further submitted that on inspection of file, the learned counsel learnt that the relevant file has not been signed by", "index": 10, "file_name": "5529_2020_5_301_20686_Judgement_14-Feb-2020.pdf"}, {"chunk": "the Minister (Home), NCT of Delhi and the Lieutenant Governor, Delhi. Upon perusal of the file relating to the mercy petition of the petitioner, it is seen that the Minister (Home), NCT of Delhi and Lieutenant Governor, Delhi has perused the relevant file and have signed the note to reject the mercy petition. We do not find any merit in the contention that there was non-application of mind on the part of the Minister (Home), NCT of Delhi and Lieutenant Governor, Delhi. 19. Re. Contention \u2013 Non-placing of relevant materials before the President of India and the relevant materials were kept out of consideration:- Placing reliance upon Shatrughan Chauhan, it was submitted that the power to commute a death sentence is not an act of grace but a constitutional responsibility of the President of India or Governor of a State. It was submitted that all the relevant documents and materials as laid down in Shatrughan Chauhan 15case and other judgments were not placed before the President of India. 20. To satisfy ourselves, we have asked the learned Solicitor General to produce the files containing the file relating to Govt. of NCT of Delhi and the office of Lieutenant Governor, Delhi and the file relating to forwarding of the mercy petition of the petitioner from Govt. of NCT of Delhi to Ministry of Home Affairs and file containing the note put up before the President of India. Accordingly, three files pertaining to the petitioner have been produced before us which we have perused. Petitioner Vinay Sharma had earlier filed a mercy petition which was received by the President Secretariat on 04.10.2019. That mercy petition was forwarded by Govt. of NCT of Delhi along with enclosures as stated in the covering letter dated 02.12.2019.

The said mercy petition was forwarded from the Govt. of NCT of Delhi to Ministry of Home Affairs on 30.01.2020 along with the enclosures stated in the covering letter dated 30.01.2020. It is seen from the covering letter that various documents were placed before the President of India viz. (i) Recommendation of the Govt. of NCT of Delhi 16in regard to grant of clemency to the petitioner; (ii) Legible and clean copy each of the judgment of Trial Court, High Court and the Supreme Court of India; (iii) Legible and clean copy of records of the case including Police Report; (iv) Nominal roll of the prisoners; (v) Latest medical report of the prisoner; (vi) Details of the review/curative petitions pending in the Court filed by the accused and other co-accused of the case, if any, along with present status; (vii) The past criminal history of the prisoner, if any; (viii) Economical condition of the family of the prisoner; and (ix) Any other documents related to the case (Order for execution on 01.02.2020). 21. Before placing the note file before the President of India, the Ministry of Home Affairs had placed the matter before the Hon\u2019ble Union Minister, Ministry of Home Affairs who applied his mind and by a speaking order, recommended for rejection of the mercy petition. By perusing the note put up before the President of India, we have seen that all the documents enclosed along with mercy petition of the petitioner and the submissions made by him in the mercy petition were taken into consideration. Upon perusal of the Note and the records, the President of India rejected the mercy petition of the petitioner.

Non-placing of relevant materials \u2013 medical status report and the status report as per the mental health of the petitioner:- The learned counsel for the petitioner had taken us through the averments in the petition and submitted that torture, cruelty and inhuman treatment of the petitioner and the physical assault inflicted on him in the prison, the petitioner was suffering from various illness and on complaints of \u201cdecreased appetite\u201d, \u201cdecreased sleep\u201d and number of other times for \u201cpsychiatric review\u201d, \u201cthought disorder\u201d and \u201cweakness\u201d, number of times, he was taken to Central Jail Hospital and the petitioner was given treatment repeatedly for those complaints. It was contended that due to inhuman torture and degrading treatment suffered by the petitioner during his incarceration, the petitioner developed mental illness and caused self-harm to himself on several occasions. It was submitted that the medical record, mental illness and the status report on the mental health of the petitioner were not placed before the President of India. It was contended that in the mercy petition, the petitioner has narrated that the petitioner did not receive adequate health care 18which would have caused his mental illness and such mental illness and procedural lapses infringe the rights of the petitioner and entitling him for commutation. It was submitted that the medical status report, Social Investigation Report and various other relevant documents were not placed before the President of India and thus, the relevant materials were kept out of consideration of the President of India. 23.

State of A.P. (2006) 8 SCC 161, this Court held thus: \u2026\u2026.. 35. Two important aspects were also highlighted by learned amicus curiae; one relating to the desirability of indicating reasons in the order granting pardon/remission while the other was an equally more important question relating to power to withdraw the order of granting pardon/remission, if subsequently, materials are placed to show that certain relevant materials were not considered or certain materials of extensive value were kept out of consideration. According to learned amicus curiae, reasons are to be indicated, in the absence of which the exercise of judicial review will be affected. 103. \u2026\u2026. For illustration, on receipt of mercy petition, the Department concerned has to call for all the records/materials connected with the conviction. Calling for piecemeal records instead of all the materials 19connected with the conviction should be deprecated. When the matter is placed before the President, it is incumbent on the part of the Home Ministry to place all the materials such as judgment of the trial court, High Court and the final court viz. Supreme Court as well as any other relevant material connected with the conviction at once and not call for the documents in piecemeal.\u201d 24. By perusal of the file produced before us, it is seen that the medical report of the petitioner along with the treatment and his latest medical report dated 30.01.2020 was placed before the concerned authorities which in turn, was placed before the President.

There is no merit in the contention that the medical report of the petitioner has not been placed before the President. 2025. The alleged suffering of the petitioner in the prison cannot be a ground for judicial review of the executive order passed under Article 72 of the Constitution of India rejecting petitioner\u2019s mercy petition. As per the settled legal position in Narayan Dutt and Others vs. State of Punjab and Another (2011) 4 SCC 353 and Epuru Sudhakar, exercise of power under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution of India is subject to challenge only on the grounds indicated thereon. When the highest constitutional authority, upon perusal of the Note and the various documents placed along with mercy petition, has taken a decision to reject the mercy petition, it cannot be contended that the highest constitutional authority had not applied its mind to the documents. 26. Learned counsel for the petitioner then urged that the petitioner comes from poor economic and social background and the Social Investigation Report of the mercy petition has not been forwarded along with the mercy petition. This contention again has no force. As seen from the list of enclosures sent along with the mercy petition, it is seen that the economic condition of the family of the petitioner and his Family", "index": 15, "file_name": "5529_2020_5_301_20686_Judgement_14-Feb-2020.pdf"}, {"chunk": "Economic Status have been enclosed as enclosure \u201cH\u201d.

While forwarding the said mercy petition, Social Investigation Report containing the economic conditions of the family of the petitioner was enclosed as enclosures. While forwarding the mercy petition dated 30.01.2020, the said Social Investigation Report dated 30.11.2019 containing family background of the petitioner and economic status of the family and other details were again forwarded. There is no merit in the contention that the Social Investigation Report was not placed before the President for consideration and the relevant materials were kept out of consideration of the President. Solitary Confinement:- 27. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner argued that the petitioner was illegally segregated and put in solitary confinement prior to rejection of his mercy petition in violation of law laid down in Sunil Batra. In the said case, it was held by the Supreme Court that \u201ca person is under sentence of death\u201d only after the mercy petition is rejected by the Governor and the President of India and on further application, there is no stay of execution by the authorities. It is 22therefore contended that solitary confinement prior to rejection of mercy petition by the President of India is unconstitutional. 28. According to the petitioner, he has been kept in solitary confinement for a period of one year. This contention is however refuted by the respondents. In the affidavit dated 13.02.2020 filed by the Director General (Prisons), Tihar Jail, it is stated that for security reasons, the petitioner was placed in one ward having multiple single rooms and barracks. It is further", "index": 16, "file_name": "5529_2020_5_301_20686_Judgement_14-Feb-2020.pdf"}, {"chunk": "stated that during that limited period, the petitioner was kept in one of the single rooms and during such duration, whenever all prisoners came out, the petitioner-convict was also coming out. It is stated that the single room where the petitioner was placed had iron bars open to air and the same cannot be equated with solitary confinement as the petitioner was permitted to come out and mingle with other inmates at regular intervals on daily basis like other prisoners. Further, it has been submitted that such placement of the petitioner in a single room was for limited duration and intermittent period either for security reasons or other reasons in the interest of convict. It is clear from the affidavit filed by the Director General (Prisons) that the petitioner was not kept in solitary confinement; rather he was kept in protective custody which was for the benefit of the petitioner 23and also for ensuring the security. Considering the averments in the affidavit filed by the Director General (Prisons), the contention of the petitioner that he has been kept in solitary confinement in violation of the principles of Sunil Batra, does not merit acceptance and this cannot be a ground for review of the order rejecting the mercy petition of the petitioner. 29. Bias Order was passed on irrelevant considerations:-. Another ground argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner is the alleged bias caused to the case of the petitioner because of the statements made by the Ministers in the Delhi Government as well as in the Union Government which have led to pre-judging the outcome of the petitioner\u2019s mercy petition even before it was placed before the President of India for consideration. The petitioner has referred to the various statements made by the Ministers to the effect that the", "index": 17, "file_name": "5529_2020_5_301_20686_Judgement_14-Feb-2020.pdf"}, {"chunk": "death sentence be awarded to the convicts to contend that such public statements had the effect of influence \u201caid and advice\u201d tendered by the Council of Ministers of Delhi to the Lieutenant Governor or by Council of Ministers in the Central Government to the President and the order of rejection is vitiated by bias. As discussed earlier, note put up before the President is a detailed one and all the relevant materials were placed before the 24President and upon consideration of the same, the mercy petition was rejected. The public statements said to have been made by the Ministers, cannot be said to have any bearing on the \u201caid and advice\u201d tendered by the Council of Ministers of Delhi to the Lieutenant Governor or by Council of Ministers in the Central Government to the President. 30. The petitioner filed curative petition before the Supreme Court and the same was dismissed on 14.01.2020. The petitioner filed mercy petition on 29.01.2020 and the same was forwarded by NCT of Delhi to the Ministry of Home Affairs on 30.01.2020. The President of India rejected the mercy petition on 01.02.2020 and the same was communicated to the petitioner in Tihar Central Jail on 01.02.2020. As pointed out earlier, the case records, judgments of the trial court, High Court and the Supreme Court, clean copy of records of the case, Nominal Roll of the petitioner, medical report of the petitioner, Social Investigation Report and other relevant documents were forwarded to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The note put up before the President of India is a detailed one and all the relevant materials were placed before the President and upon consideration of same, the mercy petition was rejected. 2531.

Therefore, the context in which an issue is presented within a film or video may be given consideration. Factors such as the setting of a work (historical, fantasy, realistic, contemporary etc.), the manner of presentation of the content, the apparent intention of the content, the original production date of the content, and any special merits of the work may influence the classification decision. (b) Theme: Classification decisions may take into the theme of any content but will depend significantly on the treatment of that theme, especially the sensitivity of its presentation. The most challenging themes (for example, drug misuse, violence, pedophilia, sex, racial or communal hatred or violence etc.) are unlikely to be appropriate at the junior levels of classification. (c) Tone and impact: Curated content may be judged in its entirety from the point of view of its overall impact. The tone of content can be an important factor in deciding the influence it may have on various groups of people. Thus, films/serials that have a stronger depiction of violence may receive a higher classification. (d) Target audience: The classification of any content may also depend upon the target audience of the work and the impact of the work on such audience. PART II ISSUE RELATED GUIDELINES This part of the guidelines comprises the issues and concerns that apply in varying degrees to all categories of classification and elaborates the general approach that may be taken in this regard to the same.

(b) Psychotropic substances, liquor, smoking and tobacco: Films or serials, etc. that as a whole portray misuse of psychotropic substances, liquor, smoking and tobacco would qualify for a higher category of classification. (c) Imitable behaviour: (1) Classification decisions may take into account any portrayal of criminal and violent behaviour with weapons. (2) Portrayal of potentially dangerous behaviour that are likely to incite the commission of any offence (including suicide, and infliction of self-harm) and that children and young people may potentially copy, shall receive a higher classification. (3) Films or serials with song and dance scenes comprising lyrics and gestures that have sexual innuendos would receive a higher classification. (d) Language: (1) Language is of particular importance, given the vast linguistic diversity of our country. The use of language, dialect, idioms and euphemisms vary from region to region and are culture-specific. This factor has to be taken into account during the process of classification of a work in a particular category. (2) Language that people may find offensive includes the use of expletives. The extent of offence may vary according to age, gender, race, background, beliefs and expectations of the target audience from the work as well as the context, region and language in which the word, expression or gesture is used.

The classification of content in various ratings from U/A 16+ to \u201cA\u201d shall depend upon the portrayal of non-explicit (implicit) to explicit depiction of sexual behaviour.(g) Violence: Classification decisions shall take account of the degree and nature of violence in a work. ***", "index": 43, "file_name": "It Rules .pdf"}]
